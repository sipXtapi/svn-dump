XPL-202 was implemented. New member mWasFired was added to OsTimer, which will enable us to find out the reason why timer is stopped - whether it is due to the fact it was fired or stopped manually.

It also fixes a race in OsTimer and OsTimerTask, when timer could fire just after it has been stopped.
