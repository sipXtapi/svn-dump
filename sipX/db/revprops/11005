Fix data race in NetInTask.
Sending data over socket is not a synchronization point, it's more like simple mem-to-mem copying. Here data is sent by one thread and received by other, so access to data must be synchronized. Lack of this synchronization may lead to such a bad things like using of partially initalized OsEvent objects, etc.
