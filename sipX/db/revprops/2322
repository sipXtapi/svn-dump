Fixed the registrar so that the correct nonce expiration
was used.  The registrar sometimes regected valid registration
requests due to an expired nonce.  It was using the expiration
date as opposed to the duration a nonce is supposed to be good
for.  This cause to large numbers to be added and a subsequent
overflow.
