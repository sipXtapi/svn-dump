XCF-1012 This issue actually represents 2 related problems introduced during T3 -> T4 transition:

[a] SelectGateways component did persist nextPage parameter - the page did not know to which page return after OK was clicked
[b] GatewayTable.edit - was trying to evaluate ruleId, which was causing Tapestry to try to resolve "rule.id" OGNL expression with rule being out of scope by that time, I replaced this with additional service parameter representing rule Id (effectively additional parameter to edit function)

I added enhanced UI test for dial plans to cover both use cases.
