A bunch of portablity changes:
  cleanup and consolidated 64 bit integer declarations for
  better portablity

  Fixed some string manipulation to make it more portable

  Fixed the MSVC6 build projects (dsp files) for:
    sipXcommserverLib
    sipXproxy
    sipXregistry

  Still have one outstanding compiler problem on MSCV6 for
  the sipXregistry.  Compiler says the method declaration
  and implementation differ, but I cannot seem to see 
  what is wrong:

sipXregistry\src\SyncRpc.cpp(72) : error C2511: 'registerMethod' : 
overloaded member function 'void (const char *,class XmlRpcMethod *(__cde
cl *)(void),class SipRegistrar &)' not found in 'SyncRpcMethod'
        sipxregistry\src\syncrpc.h(34) : see declaration of 'SyncRpcMethod'


END
