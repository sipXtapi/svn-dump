Change how SIPX_HOME's value is written to Makefiles, etc. so that it
refers to ${prefix}.  The current code captures the value of ${prefix}
at line 33 in sipXlib.m4, at which time it is NONE if no --prefix argument
has been provided to ./configure, as the default value for ${prefix} has
not been applied yet.
See http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XVX-25

Improve a text message.
