-Changed to use the name-addr format for contact field.

-Changed to use name-addr format for presence event subscription.

- Changed the default refresh time interval from 180000 secs to 300 secs. Also changed the default port setting for tcp and udp.

-Added a lot of debugging statement to help figuring out where the memory leak in sipXvxml come from. It turns out that the CpCall object cann't be deleted too quickly. A new interface is added for setting up the number of seconds to be delayed before the CpCall object is removed. The default is 0 secs.
