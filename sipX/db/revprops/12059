Fixed major SDP bug where if same payload ID is used in multiple m lines, we do not match things up correctly.
Also fixed non-standard compliance of missing c line for inactiv SDP m line
Some refactoring of the video mediaLine code
Properly scope a line fmpt and rtpmap getters so that they stay within the scope of a single m line
