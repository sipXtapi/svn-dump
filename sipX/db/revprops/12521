Made MpodAlsa::disableDevice more tolerant of situations.
It was very rigid of everything being in the "perfect" enabled state.
Such that it would bail out of disabling sometimes, leaving the MpodAlsa
with mIsEnabled == TRUE and no way to set it to FALSE.  Hense we get an
assert when deleting the MpodAlsa as it is still "enabled".
