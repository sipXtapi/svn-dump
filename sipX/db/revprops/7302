Incorporate Woof's change to fix XCL-107.  I also expanded the test coverage to better cover this test/failure case.  We don't have a good way of testing different variations in SIP messaging in the sipXtapiTest, so these test cases include random delays (you should turn on the delay in SipConnection::send) and rely on quantity of test runs.  I recommend increasing the testCallCancel and testCallCancel2 to many hundred/thousands to really beat on this test case.
