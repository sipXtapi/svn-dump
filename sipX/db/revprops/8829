  Fix race condition in OsTimer:
  If the application side of OsTimer::stop() has executed on a periodic
  timer before it fires, but the resulting message to OsTimerTask is
  processed after it fires, assert(current) fails in
  OsTimerTask::removeTimer().
  Also, improve the documentation of OsTimerTask::fireTimer(), add a
  (messy) test to show this race condition has been fixed, remove all
  uses of OsTimer::mDeleting when NDEBUG is #define'd (except
  initializing it when the OsTimer is allocated).
  This fixes XPB-630.
