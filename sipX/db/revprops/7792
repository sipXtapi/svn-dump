Fix display of OK/FAILED after waiting for watchdog to start.
Previous code did not work:
        [ $seconds == 0 ] && echo_failure || echo_success
because echo_failure exits with status 1, so echo_success will also be
executed, writing over the failure message.  One must use the idion:
        [ $seconds != 0 ] && echo_success || echo_failure

END
