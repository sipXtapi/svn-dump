XCF-886 accept serial number of AudioCodes gateway instead of MAC Address (serial number is printed on box label, MAC address is not)
calculate AudioCodes profile name from its serial number
move validation and translation of devices' (phones and gateways) serial number from common UI code to DeviceDescriptor, which makes possible to support different form of serial number for each device
