Firsrt step of major rewrite of dejitter/decoder infrastructure.
* Long dejitter is removed for now. It will reappear later in different form.
* PLC is moved from MpJitterBuffer to MprDecode.
* MpJitterBuffer' queue is no longer circular. Now it hold only one decoded packet.
* etc..

This version is resistant to clock skew, but could not handle big jitter.
