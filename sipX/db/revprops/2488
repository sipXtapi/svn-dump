Bring the hunt group reordering into the modular scheme by changing
SipHuntGroupFilter into SipRedirectorHunt.
Have SipRedirectorHunt return immediately on SUBSCRIBEs.
Add the 'method' argument to the redirect modules so they can change
their behavior based on the request method.
Fix the "fallback rule" SipRedirectorMapping so that it operates only
when there are no contacts yet.  (Add the "fallback" parameter to the
parameters hash bag.)
Add comments to redirector-test so people will know how to run it.
Adjust redirector-test so it can test multiple methods rather than
just INVITE.

END
