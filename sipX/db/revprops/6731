Incorporate fix for a problem in commons-fileupload library:
- commons-fileupload-1.1 (required by Tapestry 4.0.1) indiscriminately change all uploaded file names to lower case, this issue is fixed in the main but new version of library is not available yet
- sipXconfig will be distributing custom version of the library jar (commons-fileupload-1.1.1) until 1.2 is released
- like with all other java libraries we are distributing this in architecture independent jar format so no custom build procedures are required, however if you want to build it anyway I added a script (meta/build-commons-fileupload-1.1.1) and path file (meta/lowercase-fix.patch)

END
