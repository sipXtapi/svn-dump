Enable the VXML engine to wait for prompts to complete.
This corrects many issues with prompts being "cut off" or not played at all
in certain situations.
In sipXmediaLib:
Corrected the ability to "reset" the MpStreamPlaylistPlayer so it
can be waited on when used more than once.  The previous implemenation could
only be waited on once reliably, and it could have failed on subsequent plays.
In sipXvxml:
The OpenVXI VXML engine was missing the required "wait" functionality
that allows it to wait for in process prompts to completely play before
it does something else (like start a transfer).
Added the support for the "wait" function in osbprompt.cpp, and the support
for a null "wait" when no prompts are playing at all.
Added/enabled waiting in PromptManager.cpp and VXI.cpp.
