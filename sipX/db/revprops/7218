  A number of sipXtapi fixes:
  
  1) Make sure the SipLineMgr's thread context is started -- Thanks to Wolfgang Pichler found tracking this down.
  
  2) Make sure the network is up during sipxInitialize.  If the network is down (cannot enumerate adapaters or no valid IP addresses, sipxInitialize will return SIPX_RESULT_NETWORK_FAILURE.  If the network was down, it has been reported that sipXtapi crashes.  NOTE: This check is only performed on Win32 at the moment -- needs to be tested on other platforms before being enabled.
  
  3) sipxConfigGetAllLocalNetworkIps has been deprecated -- it allocates memory and expects the caller to free it -- this breaks the sipXtapi design and causes problems when using different c runtimes under windows.  It will be replaced in some future version.
