More codec cleanup: get rid of "DTFM term" feature of and "usesNetEq" parameter in MpCodecInfo.
"DTMF term" is a direct connection of MpdPtAvt (RFC2833 DTMFs decoder) with MprRecorder. It was created so recorder will be able to react on remote DTMFs and stop recording when # is pressed. This is possible to achieve with new notification design, I hope, and is not very useful for sipXtapi right now, thus removed.
