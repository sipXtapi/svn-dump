Change to .dsp files.
sipXcallLib .dsp now has two new project configurations:
Debug_sipXcallLib_TAPI
and 
Release_sipXcallLib_TAPI
This was a necessary change due to the fact that the
sipXcallLib project configurations, by default,
did not have SIPXTAPI defined as a preprocessor
definition.  We did not want to force developers
to have to manually add the preprocessor definition
to the project configuration every time they updated
the .dsp file from version control.  
sipXtapi and sipXezPhone .dsp files were changed to
reference the new sipXcallLib directories.
