Check in incremental changes for TLS support - it is at least partly
  working now, at least when specified using 'transport=tls'.

  This is Not Fully Tested - my most profound apologies if I've broken
  anything, but this laptop is about to get on an airplane, so having it be
  the only repository for these changes didn't seem like a good idea.

Refactored some of the SSL code into a new OsSSL module so that there is
  one place to put the special handling for getting certificates and error
  messages.  Right now, this also makes all SSL connections in
  OsSSLServerSocket and OsSSLConnectionSocket use a single SSL contexts
  (which is what it's for) through a singleton in OsSharedSSL.  A later
  change will modify the interfaces to those classes to allow for multiple
  SSL contexts and make using the singleton optional.

Added quite a lot of logging - most of this will ultimately be
  conditionally compiled, but for the moment it's on by default because
  that's how I tested it and it may help if I've busted things.
