[XRR-96] Sanity check replication configuration.
         If registry peers are configured, check that the domain name
         is not the same as the local host name, and that the domain
         name resolves to each of the peers.
         Updated documentation to clarify setting of realm and domain.
         http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XRR-96
  Factored out some useful functions for examining configuration
  settings and resolving dns names and put them in the (new)
  sipXcommserverLib/src/sipx-utils.sh, which is installed and
  can be sourced into other scripts as @SIPX_LIBEXECDIR@/sipx-utils.sh
  Improved some makefiles by removing unconditional builds in shell
  loops.
