VC6 fixes:

Remove Most Tao* all Pt* and all Ps* classes from sipXcallLib
Remove sipXtapi classes from being linked into sipXcallLib
Create new sipXtapi project/library under VS6 - matching what is done under
other compilers/platforms, adding in all sipXtapi code.
Fix speex plugin to include frame_num.c
Cleanup all projects to standardize order of include and link path lines to
ease in comparisons.
