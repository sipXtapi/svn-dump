Documentation for caller-alias.xml database.
  This is the database that allows From-header rewriting.
  This checkin adds the schema for the persistent database file, and
  an example, and checks any file in the sipdb against the schema
  during the configtest.

  Also clarified some usages in the fallbackrules example.

  See http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPR-180
