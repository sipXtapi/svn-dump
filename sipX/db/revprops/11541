sipXmediaLib: small refactoring of Audio Output Drivers.
With current implementation we don't need separate function for setting notification tickers.
We must always set it and it should always be a callback, everything else will likely break output driver's operation.
Also MpodBufferRecorder is fixed to be consistent with other drivers.
