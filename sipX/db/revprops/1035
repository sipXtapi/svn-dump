Add CONFIGURE_OPTIONS configuration variable to the set available in LocalizeSipXconfig.
Add --configopts argument to all <project>-config installation record scripts.

This allows the options that were passed to configure at build time to be available
later at run time.

(this generalizes a mechanism Dale added to the rpm builds some time ago)
