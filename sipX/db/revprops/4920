-Removed the dependency on HAVE_GIPS from sipXtackLib and fixed the issue of using wrong codecs in media subsystem.
        
-Added two new interfaces: sipxCallGetRequestURI() and sipxCallGetRemoteContact(), and added the error code and eorr text to sipxCallReject().
        
-Removed the deletion of sipUserAgent. It is being taken care of by the CallManager now.
        
-Removed the use of HAVE_GIPS in getCodecNameByType().
        
-Forgot to check in this file for removing the HAVE_GIPS flag from sipXtackLib.
        
-Moved the function checkForTag() to outside of the loop for efficiency purpose.
