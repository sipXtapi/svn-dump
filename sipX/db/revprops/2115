Removed the includes of all of the new Utl classes from OsDefs.h
  and put in the (much smaller number of) includes that required
  elsewhere.

Replaced OsBoolean with UtlBoolean (we had both, and they were the same)

Replaced UTL_NPOS with UTL_NOT_FOUND (we had both, and they were the same)

OsDefs.h now has only those definitions that are actually
  in some way platform dependent.

It is likely that:

 - Many files that include OsDefs.h don't need to any more.

 - This submission will break builds for non-Linux files
   that now need to explicitly include the Utl* classes
   they need.  I tried to find these, but probably missed some.
