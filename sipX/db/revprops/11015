MSVS automated build script

fix runWithOutput function to copy over stderr and stdout at each 100ms
interval we wait.
If we don't do this, two things happen -
* We don't see any output until the whole command finishes
* Commands with lengthy output (msdev) hang.  I'm assuming this is because 
  buffers get full and are waiting for someone to empty them before the 
  process is resumed.
