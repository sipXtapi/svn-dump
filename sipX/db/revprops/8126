Jim Park's WINCE - PostThreadMessageA, GetMessageA, etc fixes from Sunday 2006-11-26
Project settings fixes for ARM.

With this patch, WinCE emulator runs all tests (fails a few timer related tests, but runs all the way through) (portLib, tackLib, mediaLib, mediaAdapterLib) and WinCE-ARM runs portLib and tackLib tests with same results as emulator, but mediaLib and mediaAdapterLib tests fail before they even really start -- with First Chance Exception - Access Violation somewhere before the first instruction in the WinMain function (unittest.cpp).
END
