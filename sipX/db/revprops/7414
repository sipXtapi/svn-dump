[XPR-180] Allow From header rewriting - complete
  This last change modifies the behavior so that wildcard caller
  aliases are NOT used when the callers identity is from some other
  domain.

  Implementing this moved the tracking of the authoritative domains
  from SipRegistrarServer (which is the registry side) up to
  SipRegistrar (which is really the main module) so that it could be
  shared easily from the redirect server.

END
