Fixed a few bugs in MpInputDeviceDriver and MpSineWaveGeneratorDeviceDriver
  Right now there is a lot of noisy output.  THere is still a problem with
  regularity of feeding and reading.  THere is also still a problem with
  the shutdown in the MpInputDeviceDriver unit test where
  MpSineWaveGeneratorDeviceDriver does not seem to shutdown properly all
  the time.
