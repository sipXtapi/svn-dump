Undo the change made in rev 6995 to split the IMDB methods into a separate SOAP service named "IMDB Service".  Turns out that the class SOAP::RPC::StandaloneServer doesn't support multiple services, and we don't want to switch to a different server class currently.
Also tweak the utils_test to deal with a timing problem.
