First revision of documentation build script (for gnu-based systems)

Builds and packages documentation up through sipXtackLib, however, doxygen
kicks back some errors in sipXsdpLib documentation, but does not exit with
nonzero errorcode, so we don't know it err'ed out...

Documentation is packaged in sipxtapi_doc.zip at the root of the working
directory.
