For efficiency, persist the registration DB on a periodic basis rather than immediately.  The persistence interval defaults to 20 seconds but can be controlled by a config parameter, SIP_REGISTRAR_PERSIST_INTERVAL.  This parameter is provided mainly for testing and debugging, users should never have to set it.
Also reject pushed updates received from peers that have been declared UnReachable.  UnReachable peers must go through a reset before we will talk to them, to ensure that state variables are in sync.
