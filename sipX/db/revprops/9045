Fix windows implementation of  OsFile.touch() so that it works properly under all windows flavors.  
WinCE 5 does not have the _utime() function that was previously used.

made OsFileTest::testTouch more robust in it's test failure modes.
EVC4 platform is now fixed with this change, and compiles and links properly again.

END
