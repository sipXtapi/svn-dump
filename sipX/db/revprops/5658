[XSL-112] [XPL-136] Make UtlContainable types public and use them in XmlRpc

  The isInstanceOf and the TYPE constant in each of the UtlContainable types 
  was either protected or private.  Move all of these to public so that code
  can efficiently test for a type match:

  UtlContainable* foo = something();
  if (foo->isInstanceOf(UtlString::TYPE))

END
