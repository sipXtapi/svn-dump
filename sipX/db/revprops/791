Allow redirects to add headers in a redirect contact.
  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPR-36

It is possible that it would be better to determine when a
header should be replaced (using setHeader rather than addHeader).
This merits further study, but I'm checking this in now so that
it can be used in testing some of the new redirection capabilities
in sipXconfig.
