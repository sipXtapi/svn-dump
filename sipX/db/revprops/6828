Adjust merge property names to match the new scheme.  Viz.:  Delete
pingtel-3.3 and use only pingtel-main.
But both properties have been used in the past (to merge from the same
branch!), so merge their values to account for all the revs. that have
been merged from pingtel-main.
Restore listing of revs. that have been deleted during previous
merges:  6144, 6158, 6187, 6230 (lost in 6765), and 5738 (lost in 6484).
