XCF-1107 hide Audiocodes gateway support
- until Audiocodes gateway configuration is properly supported it will not be accessible in sipXconfig 3.4 UI
- one can still use Audiocodes gateway, but they have to be manually configured
- the change only affects adding new gateways, if you had Audiocodes gateways installed before, their configuration will remain visible
- this is 3.4 change only, 3.6 will have a better mechanism to select which gateways and phones are accessible
