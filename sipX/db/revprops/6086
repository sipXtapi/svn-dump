Rename the SyncStateUnknown state to Uninitialized for clarity.
Require that peers cannot become Reachable until RegistrarTest invokes the reset method on the peer, because that's when we learn the peer's sentTo value.
Init peer sentTo and receivedFrom to the invalid value -1 so that we can assert that it has been initialized properly.
Update the spec.
