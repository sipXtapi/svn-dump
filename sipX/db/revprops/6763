For XPR-144 (CDR performance):
Create a call_id index and a call_id uniqueness constraint.  Create the index explicitly rather than relying on the implicit index generated by the uniqueness constraint.  That makes it possible to turn uniqueness and indexing on/off independently, which can be useful during bulk inserts.
