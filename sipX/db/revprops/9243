Windows CE 6.0 changes.
Fix getFileInfo implementation so that it works properly under Windows CE.

Enable some tests that were disabled under CE previously.

NOTE: This will result in some currently expected failures.
This needs to be fixed though, as it is some fairly crucial functionality dealing with files.
