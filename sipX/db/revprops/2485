First working check-in of new redirector structure.
Started shaping up the redirectors to be truly modular.
Combine mapping rules and fallback rules redirectors as two objects of
one class.
Create addContact() to share code between all redirectors, and
possibly to later handle the contacts as a list.
Create doc/developer directory to hold the testing programs.
