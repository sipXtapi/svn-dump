Fix for memory leak in sipxtapi. In SIPX_CALL_DATA, contactAddress was never deleted and was even assigned a new UtlString every time an event was fired.

I will gradually check all functions in sipxtapi, and add
// jaro: CHECKED
before them to mark those that should be less buggy now. Once all functions are checked, I will remove those comments.
END
