XPR-157 new process CallResolver added to the list of managed sipX services
- new '--daemon' option added to sipxcallresolver.sh - watchdog is using it to start callresolver in service mode
- remove check that sipxcallresolver.sh has to be run by root user (there may be still some code that requires it but it needs to be fixed)

END
