Improve usage message.

RpmPackage debug/debuginfo fix

Print status information about what build labels were used and what
configuration switches that created.

Remove extraneous 'cd' output

Tighten up how the returned status from a subprocess is handled, so
that if the subprocess returns null or garbage, the test won't produce
a "unary operator expected" message, nor an invalid result.

Improve some comments on the structure of the label file.

Add --verbose to suppress -s from "make" invocations.

Add --configure to allow ./configure options to be specified on the
command line.

Allow relative directories as destination argument.

Some more adjustments to ./build so that it displays variables from
multiple labels correctly.

END
