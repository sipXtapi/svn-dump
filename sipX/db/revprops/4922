Implement XCF-521 "allow users to have multiple aliases": replace the single user "extension" with multiple user "aliases" throughout.
Add unique and not-null constraints on the user_name column of the users table and fix problems resulting from that.

Use a left outer join on aliases when querying for users.  With an inner join we only find those users who have aliases.

END
