Ensure that one can run profile generation unit tests for phone plugins hosted outside neoconf project.
It required some modifications in ModelEntityResolver which we when loading settings file. Resolver used to only look for settings.dtd file in neoconf/etc directory. This is no longer accessible for plugins - I added the code that looks on the WEB as well (which unfortunatley only works if you run the tests on the machine with access to sipfoundry.org) - this needs a better fix soon.
Also some examples of Velocity expressions in user.init.vm.
