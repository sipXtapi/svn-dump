Remove uses of UtlNameValueTokenizer::frontBackTrim, as this has been removed,
and users should use UtlString::strip(UtlString::both) -- it performs nearly
the same functionality.

In this case, uses of frontBackTrim could be swapped without any other changes with calls to UtlString::strip(UtlString::both).

The one other use of old NameValueTokenizer was just changed to reflect the new name and home of NameValueTokenizer -- now in the portability library under the name UtlNameValueTokenizer.
