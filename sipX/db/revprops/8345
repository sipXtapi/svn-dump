[XPB-764] Set the svn revision component of the sipX version number
          correctly in a working copy.
          Make the svn revision a part of the version rather than just
          using it in the build stamp; this gets it into the tokens
          in the User-Agent and Server lines.
          Add the user identifier when building from a modified
          working copy (can be overridden with SIPX_BUILD_LABEL).
          Add a function for listing services to sipx-utils.sh

END
