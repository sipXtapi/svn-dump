Fix XCF-515: for security, don't create a default superadmin user, use a bootstrap page.
Create the bootstrap page, which is called "FirstUser" in the code because it creates the first user.
In TestUtil.setSysDirProperties, set coreContextImpl.authorizationRealm to "realm".  Previously this was not being set, so we were computing the pintoken in the tests with the realm set to null.

END
