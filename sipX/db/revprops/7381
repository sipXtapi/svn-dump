Add Server or User-Agent headers (as appropriate) to most messages to
aid in identifying what component generated them, and add a property
to each that identifies the specific component (as opposed to the
default, which just has 'sipX/version').

Change priorities on some log messages that have no significance other
than for developers.

Fix numbering of redirectors.
