This includes a number of new changes as well, especially to combine
the changes to OsTimerTest.cpp for the new timer implementation with
those to make it more platform-independent.  I think the combined
version works correctly in all situations, but I've been unable to
test on non-Linux platforms.

First merge of OsTimer improvements:
mergefrom dworley-OsTimer2main 6232,6233,6239,6252
First version of new Ostimer implementation.
Compiles and passes the unit tests.
Fixes so the new OsTimer implementation passes the unit tests after
sipXportLib.  Specifically, OsTimerTask::destroyTimer has been renamed
OsTimerTask::destroyTimerTask.
Allow synchronous stops as well as asynchronous stops.  Make stops
default to being synchronous, as that guarantees that the event
routine cannot be called afterward, which was the behavior of the
previous implementation.
Fix some minor errors in the new OsTimerTask.


mergefrom dworley-OsTimer2main 6281-6318
Use more efficient implementation of OsTimer::compareTimes.
Overhaul and upgrade tests of OsTimer.
Reactivate OsTimerTest.
Improve comments in OstimerTask.h and OsDateTimeLinux.h.
Fix how timer notifier is called to supply pointer to timer, not
pointer to timer task.
Add mechanism for clean shutdown of the timer task.
In tests, print the timer skew message before asserting on the timer
skew, so if a skew test fails, there is output telling how much it
skewed.
Add debug messages for timer task start and stop.
Rename the timerQ member to mTimerQueue, per coding standard.
Upgrade various comments.

mergefrom dworley-OsTimer2main 6401-6423
Increase the tolerance on the OsTimer tests to 10ms, as Woof tells me
that the kernel's timing quantum is now 2.5ms.
Update the OsTimer tests to always check that the timer has fired
before attempting to calculate the deviation between its scheduled
firing and its real firing.
Make OsTimerTask::sLock a dynamically-created semaphore so that it
does not get destroyed when the process ends.
Replace call of gettimeofday() with OsDateTime::getCurTime.
Remove obsolete sections of the timer system, viz.:  OsSysTimer,
OsSysSoftTimer,OsTimerDb.
