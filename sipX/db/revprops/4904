Statics are not your friend -- fix for
SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps.  In SipMessage, replaced the
static SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps initializer with a pointer
and initialize it in the constructor of SipMessage.  Also, renamed
the variable to spSipMessageFieldProps instead of
mSipMessageFieldProps.  SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps touches
the UtlChainPool (also a static) and blows up under Windows.
Essentially, one cannot guarantee the order of static
initialization.  In this case, SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps
was initialized before UtlChainPool resulting in a crash during
static initialization.
