added a new method- encryptExistingProfiles to Pinger.cpp, which encrypts pinger-config and user-config, only if pinger-config contains the ENCRYPT_PROFILES : ENABLED property.  The method is called on a restart request, which comes after profiles are sent.  It is also called when the app is started, just in case profiles were sent and the app exited before a restart request was kicked off.
