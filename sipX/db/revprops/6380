[XPB-413] Clean up mediaserver_cgi zombies
          This change actually disables persistent connection support
          on the web server interface provided by the status server.
          This server is called from the mediaserver_cgi (can anyone
          suggest a way to make this _more_ complicated?).  There is
          no performance benefit, and it seems that the connections
          are not getting cleaned up properly.  Ultimately the httpd
          runs out of child processes, and prompts don't play.
