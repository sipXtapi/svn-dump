Visual Studio 6.0 is broken when it comes to statically initializing
an array of structs containing object references.

To get MpResourceTopology compiling properly under VS6, ResourceDef
and ConnectionDef had to be altered to store const char* instead of 
const UtlString&.

All other known compilers can properly initialize an array of structs
containing object references.  This is an obscure bug that it apprears
only a few others have run into.  Microsoft does not seem to acknowledge
this bug either way (that I can find).

Note: this means reduced functionality under VS6 -- only static names 
and types can be used in ResourceDef and ConnectionDef structs.
