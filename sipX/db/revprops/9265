MpInputDeviceManager.h - 
getDeviceId - change so it returns an OsStatus, improve docs a bit.
Make isDeviceEnabled const.
To clarify and simplify const methods that need to take the mutex, make mRwMutex mutable.

MpInputDeviceManager.cpp - 
Clean up unneeded syslogging to PRI_ERR, and instead to PRI_DEBUG
Correct syslogging for removeDevice (copy paste error).
No need for casting mutex member in const function now that it is mutable.
getDeviceId -- take out read lock, not write lock, fix method so it returns
OS_STATUS.

END
