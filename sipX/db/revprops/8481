XCF-1288 if BLF is configured for the phone primary user set attendant.uri and attendant.reg parameters for Polycom 650 phone
in theory that should make phone to subscribe to the same resource list that sipXconfig generated based on speed dial configuration for the primaty phone user, I do not have 650 at the moment so I cannot test it
