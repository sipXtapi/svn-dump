msinttypes update:
Explicitly cast to appropriate type INT8_MIN, INT16_MIN, INT32_MIN and INT64_MIN constants.
Due to their unusual definition in Visual Studio headers (-_Ix_MAX-1) they are propagated to int and thus do not have expected type, causing VS6 strict compiler to claim about type inconsistency.
