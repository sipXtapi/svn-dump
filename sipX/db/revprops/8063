HA Improvements
 - [XRR-123] Fix crash during shutdown in HA configuration
 - Fix crash during HA init if peer is not reachable
 - Remove inappropriate asserts on some xmlrpc faults.
   In particular, when older registration data is synced,
   the recipient was returning an error, and the sender was
   asserting on receiving that error.  Since this can happen
   under some partial reorderings or if a server is off line
   for some time, this is certainly not a reason to crash.
 - Mark peer incompatible on some severe faults.
TLS Improvements
 - Improve logging in TLS/SSL Http server connections
 - Cache peer status for TLS connections to avoid parsing cert many times
Move some IMDB errors from stderr (which is lost) to OsSysLog
Allow assert() to core dump in sipregistrar.
