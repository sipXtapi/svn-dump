Daily merge from main
    BugFix: Locking for SipRefreshManager was effectively a noop -- it
    called the OsTask::lock which was not implemented.

    XCF-922 fixed ImdbXmlHelper.configureDigester which was pushing ArrayList on the stack instead of using the createObject rule for <items/> element.
    Since reusing digester object is clearly discouraged recreate the Digester object before file parsing.
