  Changed the name of OsTimerMsg enum values to avoid conflict with UPDATE on vxworks.
  
  Cleaned up a few porting constructs for vxworks.
  
  Fixed MSVC6 dsp files so that the build works after the names of the subscribe tests where changed.
  
  Added getters for media properties.
  
  Added option to call media property setter to set either the interface or connection specific

  Fixed SipSubscriptionTest.cpp so that it binds to 127.0.0.1 after it was broken by the addition of
  multiple interface support.
  
  Fixed sipXtapiTestTransfer, sipXtapiTestConferenceAdv and sipXtapiTestConference after they were
  broken by the event change made in rev. 7707
  
  Fixed some inconsistant use of bool and UtlBoolean.
