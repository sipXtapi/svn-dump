XCF-843 bean adaptor now allows for specifying the exact subset of classes for which indexing is enabled
this funtionality is used by IndexManager to only index classes that are directly laoded (and not the once that are loaded eagerly by hibernater to support associations)
a better fix would disable eager loading (or: enable lazy loading) but I could not find a way to do that
