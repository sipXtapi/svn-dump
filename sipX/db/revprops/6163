XCF-753 revert to using inherited-binding for optional parameters of Table component
contrib:TableXXX components are using code that checks if the parameter was providing by checking if the binding for the parameter exists,
Tapestry 4 will always create a binding for the parameter (even for optional ones), unless one uses <inherited-binding> mark up to pass the parameter
there is some discussion on the developers list if inherited-binding should be deprecated but as of now it's widely used in contrib library
