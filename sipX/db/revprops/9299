Fixed XPB-867 Media Server crashes when receives an INVITE with multipart/mixed content type SDP

Merged contribution from Huijun Yang.  He writes:

By adding the following line in SipMessageTest::testMultipartBody(), ( please
see attached patch for details), I was able to reproduce the crash. 

sdpBody->findMediaType("audio", 0); 

Here is the cause: 

- In SipMessage::getSdpBody, it forcely cast the pointer to object of
  MimeBodyPart to SdpBody*. It is wrong, as an object of MimeBodyPart is NOT
an object of SdpBody. It caused an invalid memory access and resulted in the
crash. 

- Also, MimeBodyPart is a subclass of HttpBody. Because HttpBody has
  user-defined constructor, according C++ rule, MimeBodyPart MUST invoke
HttpBody constructor during base initialization. 

Verified the fix, and the modified test case SipMessageTest::testMultipartBody
passed without crash.
