Move NameValueTokenize class from sipXtackLib to sipXportLib and rename it to UtlNameValueTokenize.
This is the natural place for it. Also this make it available from all libs, not only sipXtackLib.

I think all other NameValue* classes should be moved to sipXportLib too, but I leave this off for now.
