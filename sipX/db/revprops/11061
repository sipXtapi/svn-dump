Remove erroneous and unneeded isShutDown() call.
The 'mRunDone' check suffices to tell if the run command finished.
isShutDown() only returns true if the task was specifically requested
to be shut down with requestShutDown() and the task properly processed
and acknowledged the shutdown request.  

This doesn't request a shutdown, therefore the unit test was failing 
checking the isShutdown() for TRUE.
