Fix typo in the description of Transfer Extension on the Auto Attendant web page (second try)

Changed the description of Transfer Extension
   from "Extension to used when transfer on failure is enabled"
   to   "Extension to be used when transfer on failure is enabled"

Thanks to Damian for pointing out that the righ file to fix this is
autoattendant.properties, not autoattendant.xml since texts in a .xml
file are ignored if its corresponding .properties file are present.

END
