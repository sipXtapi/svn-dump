Rollback r9861, r9862 due to a bit of strangeness in the clock.
Needs more investigation.

r9862 was conversion of MpMMTimerTest to use platform independent OsDateTime::getCurTime for timings.
r9861 was change in OsDateTime::getCurTime(Time&) to use higher resolution QueryPerformanceCounter to determine time.
