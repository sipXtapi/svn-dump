Daily merge from main:

    Add some debugging prints to the registrar to document how the various
    configuration parameters are getting set.

    [XPB-510] Configure default host address for media server
     (also fixed broken configuration for MWI notification)

    [XPB-444] Do not treat an unrecognized revision as an error in
              upgrade.
       This comes up every time we create a new release, so I'm
       changing the default.  If there is something that needs to be
       upgraded, then this needs to be modified to deal with it, but if
       there is no upgrade manipulation to do then we should not have to
       edit this script just to recognize another number.

    [XPS-24] Don't crash if SSL is not enabled.
      Note: this still won't actually work correctly; it will log a bunch
      of errors and fail, but it won't crash.
      Getting it to actually work right would be harder and more or less
      pointless since you really should use SSL to have any security at all.

    Clean up logs: [XPR-78] [XRR-59] [XRR-95]
      This removes a number of log entries that look scary (and so get
      reported in many bug reports) but are actually benign.
