Merging bug fix made to legacy source base:

Change 45940 by bandreasen@bob_frogger_all on 2004/09/27 11:59:43

Fix for digitmap bug:
	
Prior to this check-in, dialing "*123456" with the following digitmap resulted in a "vdigits" of "345" instead of "456".  The code was not looking for escaped *s and botched the results string.
	
*123xxx : sip:{vdigits}@proxy



END
