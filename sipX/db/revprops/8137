  Add ability to disable watchdog-process "process.d" XML files from being processed.
  
  Changed the watchdog schema to add an "enable" attribute to the top level "watchdog-process" element.
   
  This causes the file to be ignored if not enabled (enable="false").  
  Thus it acts as if it doesn't exist in the process.d directory, and so 
  doesn't ever get started, and better yet doesn't even show up as a service, 
  running, stopped or otherwise.  It has an advantage over just deleting or 
  renaming the file in that subsequent updates will not overwrite the file as 
  it exists and has been modified.
  
  This simplifies the HA configuration as well, as the file only needs to be
  changed in one location, not two.

  --Woof!
  
  XCF-1377 hide SMTP server setting
  
  XCF-1371 - DND per line setting was not being used in polycom profile, but it was captured in settings descriptor file and web ui
  
  XCF-1381 Allow ConfigServer to stop and start from processmanager, not just restart
  
  XCF-1382 Allow codec preferences for Soudpoint IP 300s and 4000s to be configurable
  
  FIX BUILD : Unit test failed, still have to work out polycom 4000 G729 codec showing '1' preference when its actually 'do not use'.  Something to do with null values in lists
  
  XCF-1382 Polycom 4000 G729 codec now shows 'do not use'.  I had to order it on the top of the enumerated list of options even though it shouldnt matter
