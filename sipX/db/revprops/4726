Fix for XPH-21.
very interesting bug actually - 
new UtlString arrays were allocated using:
   UtlString *realm = new UtlString[noOfCredentials];
   UtlString *type = new UtlString[noOfCredentials];
   UtlString *userId = new UtlString[noOfCredentials];
   UtlString *passToken = new UtlString[noOfCredentials];

then, deleted using:
   delete [] realm;
   delete [] userId;
   delete [] type;
   delete [] passToken;

Well, if noOfCredentials was 0 - this was bad.

So, a conditional was added before the deletes.
END
