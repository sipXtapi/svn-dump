XCF-817 Change the way the groups are deleted: replace deleteGroup function that was taking group instance with deleteGroups function that is taking colection of group ids - this allows us to load and delete groups in the same hibernate session.
Small optimization in the way objects are removed from index: only beans that are index-able are now passed to removeBean function.
XCF-801 Synchronization added to FastIndexer - to make IndexReader operation atomic (open, remove bean, close) - that should fix rae condition resulting in "IndexReader out of date exception"
