[XPR-180] Ability to modify the From header

[XRR-113] Make parallel forking of SUBSCRIBE not use mapping and fallback rules
          If rules added by mappingrules or fallbackrules are lower q
          values, then the redirector will leave them that way.  This
          will reduce useless and expensive traffic.

[XSL-138] Improve performance of URL parser, and handle large values
          better.
          Change UtlRegEx regular expression objects to limit
          recursion; this reduces performance impact and prevents some
          potential stack problems for large values in certain kinds
          of pattern matches.
