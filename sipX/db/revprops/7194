1) Added a fix for the age-old "cannot block the sipxtapi event callback thread".  We now startup a new thread to dispatch events to the application.

2) Started beating the unit tests into submission -- so far, it  looks like the unit tests are broken -- not the code

3) Reverted Dan's URL changes (didn't compile).


.. more to come: additional unit tests tweaks and build fixes for linux/macos.
