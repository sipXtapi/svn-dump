Added stun support to the OS abstraction layer.  A special thanks to Somasundaram Easwaramoorthy who pulled together the STUN client and took a first pass at integration!

Todos:
- OsStunQueryAgent should use DNS SRV to locate stun server
  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPL-96 
- OsStunDatagramSocket, stun keep alives should not block timer task
  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPL-97
- OsStunDatagramSocket should look for refresh/binding failures
  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPL-98
