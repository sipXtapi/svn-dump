XCF-194 Implemented cloning for DialingRules.

There should be a better way of implementing this, but at the moment if "persistent" object needs to implement "duplicate" funtionality it is responsible for implementin clone method.
Clone should create a clone of each collection property (the default clone implementation is shallow - creates a copy of a reference to a collection, and not a new collection referencing the same set of objects.)
