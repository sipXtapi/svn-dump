XCF-753 fix for ListParkOrbits test
not sure if thsi is HhttpUnit problem or a Tapestry 4 problem:
HTTPUnit will not include "upload file" parameter in the response unless it's specifically set,
Tapestry 4 will cause NullPointerException if it cannot find parameters related to "upload file" in the response
If there are any Upload fields on the page, you can only test the page with HttpUnit if you set those fields explicitely in your test.

END
