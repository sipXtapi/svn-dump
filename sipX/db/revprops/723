Minor modifications to the SipUserAgent and SipSrvLookup objects.

SipUserAgent: Added an accessor method to change the outbound
proxy.  Also modified the task name (added "-%d") so that
multiple instances can be coexist in the same process space.

SipSrvLookup: Added a new "setDnsSrvTimeouts" method to tweak
the timeout / retry settings for DNS SRV lookups.
