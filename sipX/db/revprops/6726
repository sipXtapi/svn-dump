In pursuit of XPR-144 (CDR performance): drop the parties table in SIPXCDR and put the caller and callee AORs directly in the CDRs table.  Simplify some queries.  Increment the SIPXCDR DB version to 2, incompatibly; since there are no production installs of the call resolver yet, an upgrade mechanism is not needed.
Looks like these changes buy us a factor of 2 performance improvement, not to be sneezed at.
