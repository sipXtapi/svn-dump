Change RegisterTest thread to do one round of peer resets before
  waiting for any timers; this fixes a problem that left all
  peers in Uninitialized state during operational phase.
  In the process, factored the reset loop out to its own method.

Changes in a few places to ensure that once in Incompatible state, a
  peer cannot get back to any other state.

Add logging at INFO and NOTICE level to confirm that synchronization
  has been configured correctly and started working.

Clarify a bunch of comments and log messages.
