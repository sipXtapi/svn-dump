Methods taking UtlStrings by value were causing access violations in their
destructors (delete[]ing the buffer) upon completion of the method context.
This bug found in new TestOsSysLogListener, and NetBase64Codec::valid and NetBase64Codec::decode
Furthermore, this was found to be significantly inefficient - especially in the
case of NetBase64Codec, as the strings passed in are very large, and there is no need
to pass them in by value (copying the string).

Solution was to pass by reference. 
TestOsSysLogListener was also using STL strings.  Replaced with equivalent functionality 
using only UtlString.

Added NetBase64Codec unit test.
