Work towards linux softphone support: Added the ability to enable local audio
support (mic and speaker) in the media processing lib.  Support for the local
audio was disabled by default for the server environments.   To enable local
audio support, please include the "--enable-local-audio" when configuring 
sipXmediaLib.  For example:

 ./configure --prefix=/myinstalldir --enable-local-audio
