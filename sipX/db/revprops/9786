MpDspUtils updated:
* Implemented background utils to perform saturation. From now all functions where target is integer saturate result.
* Improved documentation.
* Improved function naming - separated scale functions to Gain and Attenuate ones.
* Implemented non-scaling versions of scaling functions.
* Unitests, covering all (hopefully) MpDspUtils functions, written. Both for fixed-point and floating-point.
