- Various changes to build/link with GIPS VoiceEngine/VideoEngine on MacOS.
- Disabled UPNP by default
- Added VisualSlick edit projects for sipXportLib, sipXtackLib, sipXmediaPluginMgr, sipXcallLib, and sipXmdiaVoiceEngine
- Worked around a pthread lock leak by release locking before removing it

Note: This changeset will break the linux build, I will look at that shortly.  Automake/Autoconf changes required for MacOS specific link options
