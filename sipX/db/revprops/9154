support for SIP_CALLRESOLVER_MAX_CALL_LEN configuration property
active calls that last longer than SIP_CALLRESOLVER_MAX_CALL_LEN seconds are classified as completed by callresolver 
the default value is 28800 (8hours), set to -1 to disable long call aging

Aging of old calls helps in situations when call terminate events are not logged by sipX proxies.
