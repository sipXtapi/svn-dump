Windows queue replacement patch for mic/speaker. Windows queue has been replaced with sipxportlib OsMsgQ. Messages are pooled in OsMsgPool. Solves problems with audio when minimizing/maximizing window.

Added new OsIntPtrMsg which transports 2 intptr_t values. It is used by the patch.

Closing mic device has been tuned and should be faster by ~800ms. This will result in faster application shutdown time.
