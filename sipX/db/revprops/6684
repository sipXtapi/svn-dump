XCF-1012 fix for internal error after editing gateway from "select existing gateway" window
"nextPage" property was not persistent and we were losing the name of the page to which "select gateways" was supposed to return
it's been already fixed in mainline (3.3) - this is special 3.2 fix for older version of Tapestry

END
