XCF-873 added event driven service restarting support to SipxProcessContext
instead of calling manageService to restart services it is now possible to call restartOnEvent which will delay the restart until a specific even is received
added DialPlanActivatedEvent - dial plan context publishes this even after dial plan is activated
since SipxReplicationContext has lazy implementation there it now has a publishEvent method that ensures that event is published only after replication has been completed

END
