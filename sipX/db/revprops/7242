          Many changes to compile with gcc 4
           (thank you Hannu Strang for most of these)
          Several changes to the configuration macros to detect other
           differences
          Upgrade the dependent packages to later versions

           I think they now work with either 2.0 or 2.2

Revamp the code that controls the workarounds embedded in the call
pickup processor.  Instead of being controlled by environment
variables, they are now controlled by lines in registrar-config:
SIP_REGISTRAR_PICKUP_NO_EARLY_ONLY: Removes the "early-only" parameter
from generated Replaces headers, as some phones cannot handle it.
SIP_REGISTRAR_PICKUP_REVERSED_REPLACES: Adds a second Replaces header
with the to-tag and from-tag reversed, as the Pingtel code base
sometimes expects the tags in a Replaces header in reversed order.
SIP_REGISTRAR_PICKUP_1_SEC_SUBSCRIBE: Generate SUBSCRIBEs for 1 second
rather than 0 seconds, because some versions of Snom phones will not
send a NOTIFY for 0 second SUBSCRIBEs.
The values are coded "y", "Y", or "1" to activate the feature, and
"n", "N", or "0" to suppress the feature.
The defaults for these features are coded in SipRedirectorPickUp::initialize,
and are currently:
SIP_REGISTRAR_PICKUP_1_SEC_SUBSCRIBE : Y
SIP_REGISTRAR_PICKUP_REVERSED_REPLACES : N
SIP_REGISTRAR_PICKUP_NO_EARLY_ONLY : Y

END
