First checkin of CSE logging to database functionality.

Added a CallStateEvenBuilder_DB class that generates SQL insert statements
for writing events to a database.

Added a general CallStateEventWriter class that encapsulates writing
data to either a file or a database.

Added detection of REFER request in authproxy - nothing is logged yet.

Added unit tests for CallStateEventBuilder_DB.

END
