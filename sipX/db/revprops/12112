Fix (or at least, improve) the handling of Task IDs.

The problem is that they are treated as int or DWORD, but that is
not correct on Linux/64.  I invented our own typedef, OsTaskId_t,
which is defined as pthread_t on Linux.  Windows... who knows...

There is still some trouble around the formatting of OsTaskId_t values,
for example in OsSysLog.  My idea is to delegate that to a function or
functions in the platform-specific implementations (e.g. OsTaskLinux)
that take an OsTaskId_t and return a formatted value in a UtlString...
Later...
