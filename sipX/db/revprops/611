Changed required to build under Windows NT and an updated INSTALL (redirects to the sipXportLib).  Changes include:
  - adding missing includes
  - adjusting calls to UtlString::append that looked
    return code's length .. by casting to an int and
  - tweaking calls to UtlString::replace(const char, 
    const char).
  - #ifndef the definition of "pid_t" and "pipe" in
    resparse impl -- it is not used by out project and
    conflicts with decls in glib.
