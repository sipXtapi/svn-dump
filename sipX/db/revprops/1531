Log

 A number of changes to the sipXtapi API:
 
 - Removed a number of redundant settings/variables passed to the sipxInitialize method.  These settings are obtainable else where.
 - Add the regression test (sipXtapiTest) to the workspace.
 - The sipXtapiTest regression tests now working again.  Code was changed in both the lib and the tests.
 - sipXtapiInternal.cpp attempts to conform to coding standards.
 - I moved the handle mapping/allocation logic into a class
 - Regenerated documentatio
