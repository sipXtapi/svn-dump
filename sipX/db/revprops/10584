Update of codecs API: added method to get number of samples in encoded frame without decoding it.
This method is required if and only if codec packing is CODEC_FRAME_PACKING_SPECIAL. In other case number of samples will be calculated by generic formula.

This check in also include updates to codecs macros API and some other related fixes and cleanups.
