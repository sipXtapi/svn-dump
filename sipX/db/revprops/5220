[XPB-376] Fix notification of voicemail.
   http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-376

   This was caused by some changes in the handling of case sensitivity
   in HTTP query parameters.  For backward compatibility, these
   parameters will now usually be case insensitive (this was not
   really right, but since we have external applications using this
   interface, it is better to preserve compatibility than to correct
   the usage).  There were also a number of improvements made to code
   clarity and logging.

Clarify instructions on how to clear warnings about .rpmnew files

Remove extraneous print from UrlTest

Correct names of NameValuePair and NameValuePairInsensitiveTest tests
  add a unit test for hash correctness to NameValuePairInsensitiveTest

END
