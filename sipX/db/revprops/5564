Progress on XCF-763, SOAP authentication.  Add security constraints to web.xml that protect the web services URLs with HTTP Basic authentication.  Implement a dummy UserRealm implementation, JettyUserRealm, that pretends to do authentication.  Modify the Ruby unit tests to send a dummy username and password so that the SOAP client can be authenticated.
