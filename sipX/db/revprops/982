[XSL-48] addMessageObserver support for proxied responses
   The stack will now allow observers to register for and receive
   responses in a proxy.  100 responses are not dispatched to
   observers.

Many cleanups of log messages and assorted changes to make
  things conform to the coding standard and improve readability.
