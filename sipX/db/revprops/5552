[XRR-70] More liberal handling of explicit port numbers in URIs

Some UAs insist on appending an explicit port number to the target URI
of various requests, and this created a problem in matching them with
(correct) usages that did not have an explicit port.

The new configuration parameter SIP_REGISTRAR_PROXY_PORT can be (and
by default is) set to the port that the proxy is listening on.  When
set, it causes the registry/redirect server to normalize all URIs by
stripping any explicit reference to that port.  This allows
'sip:user@example.com' to match 'sip:user@example.com:5060' (by strict
rules they should not).  The strict behavior can be restored by
setting SIP_REGISTRAR_PROXY_PORT to PORT_NONE.
