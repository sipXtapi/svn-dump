Fix bug in MpResourceTopology.

MpResourceTopology::ResourceDef and MpResourceTopology::ConnectionDef structs
included object reference members.  It was intended for these to be full
fledged objects, and not references.  
When references are passed in and the orginal objects are destroyed (like if
they go out of scope), then these references are now invalid.
