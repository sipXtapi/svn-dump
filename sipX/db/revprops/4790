sipxphone migration support for the UDP/TCP port/configuration changes.
If blank ports are found for UDP and TCP, assume the user wants port
5060 on both UDP and TCP.  Otherwise, the application crashes (more
work is still needed here).  Ideally, the installer will fix this
instead of the application code.
