-added setsockopt calls for windows QOS - works under NT 4.0 and Windows 9x only 
 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/248611), no-ops for other windows versions
-Note: it is possible to link sipXtapi with a special library that intercepts calls 
 to the ws2_32.lib API's and allows a setsockopt call to work for other versions of 
 windows as well (using the windows QOS2 APIs)
