Updates to build against sipXmediaLib r94:

sipXmediaLib r94:
Allow developers to bind/rebind to audio devices under WIN32.
 
 Details:
   - You can now specify a mic device.  Previously, used the 
     matching in-call device.
   - You can now change the audio device after the Speaker
     and Mic threads have been started
   - Move the Speaker & Mic threads into their own source files
   - Folded in changed from Larry Budnick / XMR-19: "allow windows
     based servers to operate with no sound card".  Additionally,
     you can now request "NONE" as an input or output device.
   - Moved some of the global varibles into DmaTask as statics 
     (more cleanup is needed here).
