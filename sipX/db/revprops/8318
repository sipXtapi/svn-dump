Changed the name of OsTimerMsg enum values to avoid conflict with UPDATE on vxworks.

Cleaned up a few porting constructs for vxworks.

Fixed MSVC6 dsp files so that the build works after the names of the subscribe tests where changed.

Added getters for media properties.

Added option to call media property setter to set either the interface or connection specific
media property.

Fixed SipSubscriptionTest.cpp so that it binds to 127.0.0.1 after it was broken by the addition of
multiple interface support.

Fixed sipXtapiTestTransfer, sipXtapiTestConferenceAdv and sipXtapiTestConference after they were
broken by the event change made in rev. 7707

Fixed some inconsistant use of bool and UtlBoolean.

Fixed failing test case in SipSubscriptionClientTest.

All of the unit tests now pass on windows, including the sipXtapi unit tests that were disabled.
