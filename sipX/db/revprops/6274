XCF-932 Tapestry 4 does not provide the way to check if user readable message has been provided, instead if message is not found it returns modified key
Since we sometimes dynamically create the keys and we do need a fallback mechanism if key is not found I implemented TapestryUtils.getMessage function that tries to replicate Tapestry 3 functionality.
The test is used mostly to verify that Tapestry implementation of AbstractMessages class did not change, and not to validate our quite trivial implementation.
