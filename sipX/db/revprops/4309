Revise comments about ulimit.
Move the ulimit to a more sensible place in the sipxpbx script.
(Since ulimit affects the current shell, executing it once takes
effect for the remainder of the script, so there is no point executing
it once for each subprocess.  And the range of ulimit is not limited
by shell functions.)
