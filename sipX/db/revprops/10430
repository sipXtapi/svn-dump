Update OSS audio I/O driver.
Now it use less locking, but support only mixer mode. We're going to remove direct write mode soon, so this is a right things to do - reducing number 
of locks increase performance on embedded platforms significantly.
We also rename OSS driver to better conform to our naming guidelines.
