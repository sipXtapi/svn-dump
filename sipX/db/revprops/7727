- Added manditory domain element to orbits.xml schema and file parser.
- Modified pickup redirector and park server to always include domain when looking up orbits. Also, preserve the domain from the request URI when adding contacts 
by adding the address of the park server as a header parameter.
- Use 'delete' and not 'free()' to release objects allocated with 'new'.
