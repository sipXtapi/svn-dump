Finish the call direction feature.
Remove the separate call_directions table, it's too much of a hassle & doesn't buy us that much in the way of cleanliness.  call_direction is now a column in the cdrs table, although the Call Resolver and the Cdr class still know nothing about it, only the call direction plugin does.
