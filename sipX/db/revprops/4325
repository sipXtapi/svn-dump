The functions that insert new values into XML files will now work if
the value they are replacing is null or all whitespace.
In addition:
Fix spelling in some comments.
Add various logging messages.
Write the contents of any unparsable message XML file into the log so
we can diagnose the problem later.
Improve error reporting in some cases.
Do not choke if an expected text value in an XML file is empty.

END
