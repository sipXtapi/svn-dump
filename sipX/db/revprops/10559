Update sipXmediaLibTest VS2003 build - HAVE_SPEEX definitions should be consistant over sipXmediaLib and all projects, using it directly.
This is caused by the fact, that actual type (and size) of MpResampler depends on it. If sipXmediaLib is compiled with HAVE_SPEEX, but project using it do not have HAVE_SPEEX defined, this will lead to memory overwrite.
Actually this will be fixed later by providing factory method for MpResampler.
