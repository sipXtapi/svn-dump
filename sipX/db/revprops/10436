sub-configure speex if it is selected as previously, but don't blindly add
libspeex in contrib as a subdir to build.  
Doing it that way, all invocations of make would pass to it, including 
'make install' and 'make uninstall' which we did not want to have happen.  All 
we really need is 'make', 'make clean', and 'make distclean' to pass on to
libspeex, if it is selected.

So, this now does just that -- it literally invokes:
'$(MAKE) -C libspeex' at the 'all-local' target
'$(MAKE) -C libspeex clean' at the 'clean-local' target, and
'$(MAKE) -C libspeex distclean' at the 'distclean-local' target.

And is now not contained in the "SUBDIRS" make variable.
