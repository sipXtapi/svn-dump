Temporary fix:
#ifdef out the tests:
     CallManagerTest::testUATeardown
     CallManagerTest::testLineMgrUATeardown
     CallManagerTest::testRefreshMgrUATeardown
so that sipX will build.

Put parentheses around #define expression.

Do not treat an absent port number as equivalent to the default port number.
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-96

Remove sipXconference from the process definitions for the time being, because
it is not done yet.  If it appears in ProcessDefinitions.xml, then
the config UI will display it as a process (that has not been started).

END
