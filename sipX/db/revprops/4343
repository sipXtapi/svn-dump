Get "Delete message" link in notification e-mail to work.
Change getMessageIdsFromQuery() so the checkbox value doesn't need any
particular value, since some of our generated links have a value "yes".
Fix status messages in PlayMessagesCGI::handleWebRequest to say
"message(s)", since the request may have modified only one message.
