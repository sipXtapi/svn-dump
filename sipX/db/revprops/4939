-Modifcations to installation and upgrade scripts to deal with new version numbering

-More fixes to the upgrade script

-Added some debug traces.
        
-Created the media subsystem adapter libraries.
        
-Separated the media subsystem from sipXcallLib.
        
-Get config from external and set svn:ignore property.
        
-Removed the unittest until we know how we should handle it properly because of the dependency on sipXmediaAdapterLib.
        
-Make the callId generation depending on the time.
        
-Fixed the error in generating the resource list.
        
-Removing MSVC 6 project files -- we are not longer supports MSVC6 -- only MSVC7
-Setup ability to build under Windows for main line (Debug, Release, Debug_NoVideo, Release_NoVideo):
        
        1) Renamed sipxtapi.sln/vcproj to sipxtapi-VoiceEngine.sln/vcproj
        2) Re-added sipXmediaVoiceEngine project given new path in sipXmediaAdapterLib (was in vendor/gips)
        3) Updated paths to GIPS interfaces (was relative to ../gips -- now  relative to ../sipXbuild/...)
        4) Added an "EXCLUDE_STREAMING" #ifndef check to disable streaming -- otherwise we have a dependency on opens source mp layer.
        
        5) Removed phonset components from sipXcallLib build -- these are only needed for sipXphone which already doesn't build. 
        
        NOTE: sipXtapi Unit tests don't run on main (not even close to working).  We need to finish the merge from sipXtapi before attempting to get these unit test to run.
        
-new sln and vcproj files for sipXtapi
        sipXtapi.sln is the open-source, non-gips solution file
        
-new project file for sipXmediaMediaProcessing
        
-removed HAVE_GIPS
        
-Moved the LinePresenceMonitor module from sipXtackLib to sipXcallLib to support TUI sign-in/out for ACD.
        
-Modified to require for the correct libraries to be installed.
        
-Latest sipXtapi code

-Fixed compiler warnings in callbacks.cpp under Linux.
        
-Verified sipXtapiTestLine unit tests run under linux -- also removed compiler warnings.
        
-Verified the transfer and config tests run under linux -- fixed compiler warnings.
        
-Fixed stun unit tests (merge problem?) -- Bad STUN addresses never failed, but just kept refreshing (if a new socket was allocated with same pointer as a previous one).
