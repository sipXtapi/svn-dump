Widebandify playBuffer functionality - to play audio data from a buffer to a media interface.

NOTE: Now you must specify the sample rate of the data you are passing in.
It no longer assumes 8000kHz.  It will support at least any sample rates up through 48000Hz.  These samples will be resampled to the internal media interface sample rate.
