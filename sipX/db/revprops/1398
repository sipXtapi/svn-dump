Checking in the start of a tapi-like API built on top of
call processing.  This API is being built to customer
requirements and is still under development.  Unit tests
(sipXtapiTest), a "PlaceCall" example, a "ReceiveCall" 
example, and doxygen generated API docs are also included.

You must define "SIPXTAPI" when building sipXcallLib to
receive event notifications.

The examples and unit test will only build under Windows.
