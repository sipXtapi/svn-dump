Update configure and makefiles to work with the changes in the shared
library configuration macros.

This is a hack - the configuration of the libraries is not used, and
future changes they require will (again) have to be propogated here
manually.

This change set appears to get the c++ part of the phone build
working; my system does not appear to be able to build the java.
