1) Re-created sipXportLib VC71 projects and removed VC6 and VC8
   projects.  These will need to be re-created (or deletions should not
   be merged back to sipXtapi trunk).
2) Created contrib directory and checked-in cppunit 1.12.1 with libs
   MSVC libs build with /MT and /MTd (default uses DLL version of
   runtimes).  Other contrib will be moved from calllib or added.
