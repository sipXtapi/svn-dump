Fixed a number of problems reported against the stun implementation:

XPH-82: sipXphone will not take call off hold (http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPH-82)
XPH-85: no audio after NAT'ed call came off hold using STUN and symmetric SIP (http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPH-85)
(dev-list): One-way-audio after 20 seconds

Essentially, the STUN integration in the OS abstraction layer transparently received STUN packets, passed them to a handler task, and then blocked waiting for more data.  This is the correct approach for many of the signaling server tasks, however, isnâ€™t correct for media processing.  In NetInTask, the code selects on a bunch of sockets (control socket, all rtp sockets, and all rtcp sockets) and reads when data is available.  Causing the read() method to block effectively halted media processing.
