Delete generated vxml files before recreating them to resolve ownership problems.

Generated vxml files should now be owned by the sipxchange user, not root.  
In an upgrade situation previously generated files are still owned by root,
and thus cannot be modified.  Fix this by deleting them first.  (They can
be deleted as the directory is now owned by the sipxchange user, even if
the file is owned by root).
