Fixes to mappingrules and fallbackrules for some modifiers
   [XCS-9] fix syntax of field parameters added by mapping rules
   [XCS-11] field parameters added by mapping rules now always append
   [XCS-12] header parameters are now inserted correctly

   All unit tests for the above pass, and illustrate the supported
   behavior.  We still need better documentation of what that is...

This provides some of the underpingings needed to implement XPR-180
and some other improvements to routing.
