Finish reverting rev. 3920, which was a complete mistake.
sipXregistry/include/RegisterHook.h was deleted in rev. 3926.
Add log-debug to the PHONIES list.
Allow TiXmlBase::SkipWhiteSpace to work correctly when *p == '\0' by
returning successfully.
Revert rev 3891 (except for an improvement in a debugging print).
That rev was to work around the bug in XPL-127.  Now that rev 4040 has fixed
that bug, remove the workaround.
Add test for TinyXML problem XPL-127.
For the time being, force the "no early-only" behavior in all call
pick-ups.
Fix handling of parameters on the remote contact address in dialog
event notices.
Add workaround so Snom phones can pick up calls.
Split SipClient::isReadyToRead into two functions:
SipClient::isReadyToRead, which is a non-blocking test for socket-ready-to-read,
and SipClient::waitForReadyToRead, which waits.
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-111
Fix use of compareTo so non-default port designations are recognized as such.
Update DISTCLEANFILES.
Document invocation of autoreconf.
Add entries for sipXconference, but do not activate them.
Revamp handling of headers specified in URIs.
Statics are not your friend -- fix for SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps.
Put parentheses around expression in #define.
Improve copyright notices.
Fix the sip*.sh.in scripts to check that the log files for their components
are either absent or writable, so the components can log any problems they
find.  Otherwise the components have no way of reporting problems.
Add sipXmediaAdapterLib as a component.
Link in a media subsystem.
Move mediaAdaptorLib before callLib in the build order, as the
dependencies have been rearranged.
Remove special OpenSSL from code base.
Remove call of isReadyToRead() from a debugging print, as that function blocks.
Report "residual" bytes after a SIP message as an error in UDP, but as debug
info in TCP and TLS.
Put files that depend on the install directory into DISTCLEANFILES.
Add an orbits.xml file to the test configuration.
Remove erroneous element in ProcessDefinitions.xml.
Fix typo in .spec file:  RPM is sipxcommserverlib-devel, not sipxcommserver-devel.
Add commentary based on an inquiry by Jerry Richards.
Add a file describing call flows for the call pick-up features.
Correct REPOSITORY for new repository structure.
Test fix for SipUserAgent/OsTimer/OsSysSoftTimer lockup:  Increase the message
queue sizes from 1,000 to 10,000.
Add more logging of transaction garbage collection.
Parse URIs correctly -- field parameters have their own unique quoting
system.
Add function SipMessage::isInSupportedField to allow easy testing for tokens
in the Supported header.
Add first cut of GRUU handling.
Enable siptest to send OKs in response to NOTIFYs.
Allow test configurations to use a realm that is different from the domain.
Add workaround for putative TinyXML parsing bug.
Add the code for the special Multi-Party Test redirector.
This can be used for multi-party loop/fork/spiral tests, and also as a
testbed for turning the redirectors into a proper set of hook
components.
Update the clean-check.sh script.
Add the dialog event testing tool.
Update svn:ignores properties.

http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-137
Implement Christian Stredicke's workaround so call pickup works with
current Snom phones.
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-319
Overhaul OsFileLinux::getFileInfo, as it had 3 errors and was poorly
coded as well.
Also fix some formatting problems.
Revamp SipRedirectorPickUp to re-read the orbits.xml file when it has changed.
Allow mappings that send an extension into "retrieve messages for
extension NNN".
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-256
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-245
Update test configuration to take into account 3.0 configuration features.
Fix test of requested expiration time vs. minimum allowed expiration time.
Also, install workaround to allow the workaround of ENG-319 to work
when retrieving calls from Park Server.  (Ugh.)
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-399
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-319
Ignore NOTIFYs that do not contain bodies, so the Redirector doesn't
crash when it receives one.
