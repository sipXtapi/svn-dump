 bunch of instrumentation for MprRecord to help catch GSM recording corruption.
Turned out to be problem with opening same record file with append immediately
after stopping the record.  There were two file descriptors open on the same
file.  On Windows at least, this causes unpredictable results.  For now we 
make this the application's responcibility to wait for record stop notification
before starting to record again with same file.
