Revamp all makefiles to improve libtool usage.

 * All dependencies between shared libraries are now automatic,
   so you only need to declare the immediate dependencies when
   linking a library - if that library needs any others, they 
   are added for you.

 * All shared libraries now have explicit version numbers.

Removed many duplications in the flags passed to the C++ compiler.

Incidentally, did some cleanup on doxygen usage.
