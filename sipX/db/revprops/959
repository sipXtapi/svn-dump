Rewrite of URL parser.
  Now does more strict recognition.
  No longer attempts to recognize both url and field parameters when there are no
  angle brackets.
  Fixes:
    [XSL-63] name-addr parsing errors if the display name contains certain punctuation
       http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-63
    [XSL-76] add support for 'sips' urls
       http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-76
    (may help some others, including XSL-49 and XSL-58)

END
