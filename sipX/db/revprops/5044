Fix XCF-617: Users with superadmin privileges cannot edit their call forwarding. Add a quick link to UserCallForwarding from the EditUser page.  To prevent users from editing the call forwarding info for other users, add a security check that permits only editing of the logged-in user, unless that user has admin rights.
