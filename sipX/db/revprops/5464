Implement Christian Stredicke's workaround so call pickup works with
current Snom phones.
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-319

Fix handling of parameters on the remote contact address in dialog
event notices.

Add workaround so Snom phones can pick up calls.

Overhaul OsFileLinux::getFileInfo, as it had 3 errors and was poorly
coded as well.
Also fix some formatting problems.

Revamp SipRedirectorPickUp to re-read the orbits.xml file when it has changed.

Allow mappings that send an extension into "retrieve messages for
extension NNN".
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-256
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-245

Update test configuration to take into account 3.0 configuration features.

Fix test of requested expiration time vs. minimum allowed expiration time.
Also, install workaround to allow the workaround of ENG-319 to work
when retrieving calls from Park Server.  (Ugh.)

Ignore NOTIFYs that do not contain bodies, so the Redirector doesn't
crash when it receives one.
