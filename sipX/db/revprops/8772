Add OsSysLog logging to sipxunit framework so that
unit tests now generate log files.

   The unit test log files are generated in the directory
   where the test is run, which is normally the same as
   where the 'testsuite' libtool wrapper script is created.

   Log files are named <class>__<test>.log, so identifying
   them is straightforward.
