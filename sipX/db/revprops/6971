Handle unexpected errors from pthread_cond_wait() and pthread_cond_timedwait() by asserting.
Previous implementation might "spin" on unexpected errors.
Add more unit tests for mutexes and semaphores.

Change from
  /proc/sys/kernel/suid_dumpable
to
  /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
Because the latter appears to be the correct name
(see http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6145)
Also use 1 instead of 2 as experiment shows that
2 doesn't work, yet 1 does, and indeed the files
are only readable by root, so are just as secure.

Catch only the normal shutdown signals.
Let the others cause core dumps so
we can fix the problem.
This coupled with changes to sipXvmxl.sh to
enable core dumps by suid processes should
enable sipXvxml to drop core.

Don't delete userAgent as the CallManger destructor does that.
If we delete it here, we get crashes when we CallManager tries to as well.
I don't agree that CallManager should delete userAgent, as userAgent
is passed in to CallManager, and thus should be deleted by whomever
created it.  But this is the path of least resistance, as all other users
of CallManager seem to know not to delete the passed in object.

Handle differences 'tween FC,kernel.org kernels and RHEL
