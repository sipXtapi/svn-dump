Remove extra setting of SIPXPBXUSER.
Add comments about configuration editing command groups.
Fix no-config-server so that it does not multiply-comment lines.
Add the install-httpd command group to edit the Apache config files.
	(It doesn't work yet, but should cause no harm.)
Fix the search-NONE command group to test the result of the grep correctly.
	Also, make sure that it does not detect and flag itself while looking
	for occurrences of "NONE".
Test the result of the grep in search-unsubstituted correctly.

END
