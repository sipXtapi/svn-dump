First step of MprBridge big update.

From now MprBridge is a full featured matrix mixer. That is you could specify transition gain for every input to output port pair.

At this point it is very inefficient, implementing true N*N approach. However it is not noticable on decent x86 systems when working as a SIP client. We'll gradually improve its performance to allow new mix matrix mixer usage in more constrained environments.
