Video update:
- defined codec IDs for H263-1998 & H263-2000 (AFAIK the payloads are identical, they differ only by the supported MIME attributes and H263 annexes)
- video codec runtime selection
- video scaling support in MpvoGdi (rendered video is scaled to match the client area of output window, it's the client's responsibility to set the desired size)
- various bugfixes & tweaks for H263

Regarding the codec negotiation: there is still a lot of work to be done in order to be able to request specific bitrate, framerate, video size etc. Currently I commented out code which was dealing with obsolete MIME attributes like "size" or "imagesize", however I'm thinking of generalizing this process slightly.

Thanks to Andrzej Ciarkowski for this patch.
