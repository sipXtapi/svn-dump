Enabled testing of Opus OGG encoded recordings and fixed lots of bugs with the unit tests:
  + Refactored a bunch of code to reduce duplication.
  + Fixed cases where it was falsely assumed destructor would close recording, but were not due to looping.
  + Fixed GSM frame count and size calculation.
  + Added support of slop or tolerence to file size calculations for codecs which do not have constantant frame sizes.
  + Clean up queued messages for failure cases (e.g. append with invalid codec type).
  + Better logging and printf info for failure cases to help diagnose error.
