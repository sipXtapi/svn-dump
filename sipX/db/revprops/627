Fixed warnings in sipXtackLib.  Mostly char* being assigned quoted
strings, comparison between signed and unsigned, format type
mismatches.  Added prototypes in several src/resparse files.

Also, added guards (#ifndef FILENAME_BASED_STRING...) to resparse
include files; and added extern "C" {}.

Removed some chunks of dead, commented-out, code when found in the
vicinity of the warnings, to make the code more readable.
