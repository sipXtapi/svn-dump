Implement domain aliases in the registrar

   Resolves http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XRR-2

The new registrar configuration directive
  SIP_REGISTRAR_DOMAIN_ALIASES :
is a list of domains (which may be IP addresses) that are to
be considered acceptable as the target URI in a REGISTER
request.

By default, this is initialized to include the default IP address.

Note that this has no effect on the domain part of the address
of record values; it does mean that UAs that cannot do DNS can
register.
