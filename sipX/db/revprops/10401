Remove ptapi tests.  We have no need for ptapi at all anymore.

It is currently not included in sipXcallLib, but the tests were never removed
from the Linux build, so this resulted in build failure -- unresolved
references.

ptapi itself should be entirely removed from sipXtapi, and is in the plannings
to remove it soon.
