Turning off RtpReceive before a hangup, and if no RTP address exists.  This fixes the 'machine-gunning' problem. 
(In sipXphone, in a conference, if a party is put on hold, the last buffer received from them is repeated over and over).

However, this is probably a band-aid.  The real fix for this is probably in the FlowGraph??
