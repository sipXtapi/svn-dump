If unit test fails while sine input device driver is still added 
to device manager, prior to this change, the device manager would assert
failure in it's destructor because it asserts that there are no
devices connected when it is destroyed.

To fix this issue, I catch the cppunit exception and remove the device
from the manager, then rethrow the exception.
