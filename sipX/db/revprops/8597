Corrected call to OsDatagramSocket to enable remote host and port.

A problem was manifesting itself as many more sockets than expected 
were being used for SIP transactions.  Turns out not setting remote 
host and port caused the upper layer SipClient code to create a new 
socket for each and every UDP packet that needed to be sent, and kept 
the previous one around as well!

Under light load, this caused proxy and authproxy (and probably others) to
run over the 1024 per process (default) file descriptor limit, resulting
in failed calls.

By setting the remote host and port, the SipClient code will re-use the
existing socket for sending packets addressed to the same place.
