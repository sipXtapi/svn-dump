Next stage in adding STUN support to sipXtapi and eventually the sipXphone
project.

From sipXtapi you can now decide to use a NAT_MAPPED address or a LOCAL
address on a per-line basis.  REGISTER messages will include contacts with
either the STUN-derived contact or the local contact.

I also fixed a few local contact issues while looking through the code.  We
now include a contact with most responses.  We also now include a contact when
sending a OPTION method (it was missing).
