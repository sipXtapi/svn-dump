Even with non-proxy based authentication, we should always
validate the MD5 hash with the Auth header uri parameter.
The code was using the request URI for registration rquests
incorrectly assuming the request URI and the Auth header
uri parameter would always match.

There should be a bug/issue number coming for this.  This
was found when testing registration with the Sipura gateways.
Sipura puts the user name in the Auth header uri parameter
(which is incorrect) and not in the REGISTER request URI
(which is correct).
