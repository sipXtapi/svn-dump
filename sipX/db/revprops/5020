Clean up definition and use of socket protocol types
  Replace 'enum SocketProtocolType' with a typedef 'IpProtocolSocketType'
  and make all interfaces and uses of this type use it rather than 'int'.
  Do translations to strings using static OsSocket::ipProtocolString method.
Fix [XCF-59] - the log message for leftover bytes was just wrong for
  anything but UDP, so eliminated it for those cases (and changed the
  severity to WARNING for UDP because it may indicate an error in the
  message sender).
  The log entry about 180 not being dispatched probably does indicate
  some error, but is not related to this issue other than by the fact
  that both occur at similar load levels.  That is tracked elsewhere.
