Fix problems with recognition of url vs field parameters
  (and add a unit test that tells the difference)

Clean up toString to produce a more uniformly canonical form
   This has the effect that removeAngleBrackets is now a no-op
   because they are never used unless mandated by includeAngleBrackets
   or required to make the content of the url unambiguous.
