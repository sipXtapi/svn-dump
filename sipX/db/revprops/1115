Fixed a bunch of compile issues with include paths
and #defines related to optionally compiling in 3rd
party jitter and lost packet compensation utilities.

Added autoconf macros to allow optional compile and
linking of 3rd party jitter and lost packet 
compensation into the media processing subsystem.
