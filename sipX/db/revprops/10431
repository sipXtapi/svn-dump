Specify that we need at least autoconf 2.60 --
I believe all we need is 2.59c, but I am unsure if the AC_PREREQ can deal with
alpha suffixes, so I bumped up the requirement to 2.60.

Reason for bump up in autoconf version requirement is that we now
auto-configure speex if it is not present, or if it is requested when
configuring sipXmediaLib.  speex requires at least 2.59c.  Reason it requires
this is because it uses 'new' C99 integer types that are now widely supported
in compilers.

NOTE: sipX itself should be adding these checks in it's own configure.ac 
files, as it uses C99 integer types.
