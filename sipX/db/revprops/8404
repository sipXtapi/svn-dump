  Added Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 project files.
  The file extension for msvc2003 and 2005, and presumably future versions of
  microsoft visual studio now share the same file extension, for both project
  files, and solution files (what used to be workspaces, which now keep local
  settings separate from settings that can be persisted in source control
  (project file references, and inter-project dependencies - build order).
  
  Prerequisites:
  MSVC8 configured to find PCRE and CPPUNIT include directories.
  MSVC8 configured to find PCRE and CPPUNIT library directories.
  PATH set to find PCRE dll (will need a reboot if you wish to start or debug
  the exes from within msvc8)
