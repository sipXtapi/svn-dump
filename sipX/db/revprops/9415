Previous commit fixed XCL-127 "If you call sipxConfigEnableStun multiple times very fast, no stun response is received because we call enableStun(szServer, iServerPort, iKeepAliveInSecs, NULL) in it , which causes the old Notification object in OsNatDatagramSocket to be overwritten with NULL, so they don't know where to send the result. ", not a memory leak.
