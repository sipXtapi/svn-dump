Added the voicemail.xml and httpd-sipxchange-mediaserver*.conf files to the
sipXpbx project.  They belong here -- not in sipXvxml.  The sipxchange-common
configuration files (for apache) now include the appropriate  mediaserver conf
files.

I also fixed a pathing issue the location of the ssl certificates.  They are
now located in PREFIX/etc/sipxpbx/ssl instead of PREFIX/etc/sipxpbx/etc/ssl.
