Set From header (CallerID) on REFER generated INVITEs to match.

Previously, when the UA was asked to transfer a call by REFER, the
outgoing INVITE might contain just an IP address and port number
in the From header.  This change sets the OutboundLine (and thus the
From header) to the value from the To header in the REFER.  Thus the
new call contains the same CallerID info that the original call
had, so the transfered destination can see the identical connection 
information.

There is a possiblity of call spoofing here, (forcing the system to generate
a new call with the caller ID of someone else) but as the REFER is an in-dialog
request changing the To header is not expected.  And any external calls
would be challenged for authentication anyway.

--Woof!
