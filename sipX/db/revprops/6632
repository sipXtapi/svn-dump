Progress on XPR-120: Call resolver (CDR): support HA configurations with distributed proxies.  Work on loading CSEs from multiple DBs and merging the resulting event sets.
Tune up some logging code.  Using blocks with log methods is a cleaner way of avoiding extra work, rather than checking explicitly whether logging at a given level is enabled.
