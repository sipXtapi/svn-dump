XCF-1302 clicking on a link to Caller Sensitive dialing did not save current page - it caused exceptions if the rule has never been save by the user (i.e. when creating a new emergency rule)
reorgainzed the page to display the link only when "Use Caller Sensitive Routing" box is selected, hide the list of gateways when caller sensitive routing is used

END
