Add httpd.conf, because we now allow processing CGI scripts.

Add registrar-config.in, to record the explicit minimum registration
expiration of 5 minutes.  (So we can detect UAs that we goad into
re-registering more frequently.)

Add "scripts" directory to hold reporting scripts and the crontab file
that drives them.

Add dialog-event.cgi to find and analyze the last dialog event package
from an extension.

Update index.html to use <pre> for preformatted lists, rather than
<code>, which does not respect line breaks on some browsers.

Update registrations.cgi to list User-Agent values, print table values
in <code> font, insert <wbr/> tags to allow breaks so the table is no
wider than the browser's screen, align numeric fields rightward, and
attempt to avoid flowing the text around the table.

END
