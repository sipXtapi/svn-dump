XPB-756: Starting sipXpbx changes file ownership and permission of /user/bin/sipXvxml

Apply Misha's patch

sipxpbx checks if sipXvxml has the right ownership and permission
if it does not, change it so that it has the right ownership and permission.
Otherwise, leave it alone.

(The previous version changes sipXvxml without doing the check first.) 

END
