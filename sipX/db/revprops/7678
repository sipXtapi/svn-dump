Add code to properly signal and release the OsProtectedEvent allocated
in CallManager::bufferPlay.
Correct how the ending time of a re-SUBSCRIBE is calculate.
In getPublished, when the default constructor is missing, return NULL
via the appropriate argument, rather than leaving it un-defined.
Put the Subscription-State header in NOTIFYs, as required by RFC 3265.
Remove a call to SipPublishContentMgr::unpublish, as with the new
memory management scheme for that class, it is not needed.
Correct the presence status values to "open" and "closed", per RFC
3863 section 4.1.4.
Fix a use of SipPublishContentMgr::publish which is usually
conditionalized out, and so had suffered bit rot.
Generate Accept headers on SUBSCRIBEs to specify the media-type we
desire.  (Not mandatory under RFC 3265, but a good idea.)
Put the right content-type (application/dialog-info+xml) on dialog events.
Use the symbolic name SIP_DIALOG_EVENT_CONTENT_TYPE for that string.
Put a comment on the call that puts an Accept-Language on most requests,
noting what it means.
Fix SipMessage::setSubscribeData to set the Route header only if there
is a non-empty value for it.
Add a default content constructor to SipPresenceMonitor so we can
produce correct presence notifications for users that we know nothing
about, which is the state before the user signs in/out the first time.
Add an assert that will catch mis-used timers a little earlier than
they are now.

Improve tests and debugging prints.
