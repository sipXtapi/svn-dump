Add libtool la linkage to make unit tests actually run via 'make check' on autoconf/automake platforms.
Fix defaultAudioMicRead to initialize the # of recorded samples which proves fatal on platforms that don't initialize variables to 0.
Fix CpPhoneMediaInterfaceTest to utilize embedded prompts and fairly easily statically disable recording.
Add important directions for EVC4 build to readme.txt (telling them the batch file to run to actually build, which was previously left out)
