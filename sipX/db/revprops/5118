Changes related to XCF-643, although I have not succeeded in fixing that bug.
Make all DB test classes descend from SipxDatabaseTestCase.
Add a teardown method to SipxDatabaseTestCase that closes the connection, but comment it out for now because it is causing problems.
Add commented-out DBCP config parameters for debugging connection leaks.

END
