First checkin of N: Allowing pluggable media processing support

In this checkin:
- Cleaned up the CpMediaInterface by removing unused methods and
  adding some additional documentation.  All functions are also
  now pure virtual in CpMediaInterface.
- Introduced a factory mechanism to create/bind to a media
  processing subsystem.

More work to do...
