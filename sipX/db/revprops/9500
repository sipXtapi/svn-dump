new resource messaging approach to playBuffer implemented.
PlayFile now properly fixed so it uses playBuffer underneath.
Broke out and did some code cleanup of the audio file reading routines - for code-reuse (needed static audio file reading code).

Tested with CallFlowGraph and TopologyFlowGraph under windows XP, compiled using vs2005.
