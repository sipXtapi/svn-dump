Fixes to make unit test build work with portable unit test framework (instead of CPPUNIT).
  Removed duplicate entry of UltRegEx test suite.
  Conditional use of CPPUNIT vs. portable unit test framework
  Temporarily removed stun and turn unit tests as they have not been ported to portable unit test framework completely yet
