Fix for memory leak in CpMediaInterfaceFactoryImpl, in mlistFreePorts.find(new UtlInt(rtpPort)) it's not a good idea to allocate new object and forget it. It's better to use just find(&UtlInt(rtpPort)). From documentation - find - "Find the first occurence of the designated object by equality (as 
     * opposed to by reference)."
