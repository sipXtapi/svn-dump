Daily merge out from main:
    XCF-910 - Set lucene lock directories thru system props.  Unfort
    ant is setting java.io.tmpdir and we are setting it to configure
    jetty so this property overrides all system properties

    Revise how Call-IDs are generated so that multiple applications on a
    single host cannot produce duplicate Call-IDs.
    This is issue http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XCL-51.
    This includes importing the UtlLongLongInt implementation.
    Make the generated Call-IDs a little shorter by hashing all the fixed
    fields with MD5 and using only the first 16 hex characters.
    Make CpCallManager::getNewCallId(const char*, UtlString*) static,
    since it doesn't depend on any member variables, and it could be used
    by anybody to generate Call-IDs.
