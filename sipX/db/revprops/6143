XCF-753 yet another fix for settings pages: 
new TextField component's value parameter has to be bound to specific type of object (in tapestry 3 you could always bind it to string)
we already had getTypedValue function for our settings, I have added setTypedValue and I use this in SettingEditor for Numeric and Boolean values

END
