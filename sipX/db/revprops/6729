Merge 6704,6726,6727 from sipx-3.4:

Improve stunnel_connection by replacing duplicated error-handling code with a shared method raise_exception.

In pursuit of XPR-144 (CDR performance): drop the parties table in SIPXCDR and put the caller and callee AORs directly in the CDRs table.  Simplify some queries.  Increment the SIPXCDR DB version to 2, incompatibly; since there are no production installs of the call resolver yet, an upgrade mechanism is not needed.
Looks like these changes buy us a factor of 2 performance improvement, not to be sneezed at.

More CDR performance tuning (XPR-144).  Per advice in the PostgreSQL manual, commit all the CDRs in one ginormous transaction, rather than using one transaction per CDR as before.  Appears to improve performance noticeably, but the times that I recorded vary by up to a factor of 2, so not clear what the impact is. However, the worst time I recorded was slightly better than the best time I recorded previously.  To get decent stats, I'll need to do longer runs with bigger data sets.
