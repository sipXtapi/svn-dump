XCF-823 one can now inject mappingrules. fallback rules and auth rules from external files
in order to do that modify sipxconfig.properties.in file and set the following properties (depending on which file you want to modify)

mappingRules.externalRulesFileName
fallbackRules.externalRulesFileName
authRules.externalRulesFileName

the property value should designate a valid XML file (in the same format as the file that you want to modify)
entire content (all children of the root mappings element) of the external file is inserted before the content generated by sipXconfig UI
 
if external file does not exist or has invalid format dial rules are still generateda and errors are logged in sipXconfig log

END
