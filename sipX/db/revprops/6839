Adding most of the changes necessary to build and run sipXezPhone on Mac OS X.

A few key additions:
* OS X code to enumerate and select a network interface to listen on.
* OS X audio driver (must be enabled with --enable-local-audio)
* Bugfix for UDP socket initialization code needed on OS X
* Small auto* tool tweaks to detect and work with OS X
* wxWidgets GUI code fixes to work with OS X glitches
* An icon for the OS X version of sipXezPhone (*)

There is another piece to be added shortly - a script to collect all the pieces
into an OS X application bundle. This bundle can then be distributed in an OS X
disk image file, and run like any other OS X application.

(*) The icon was created from a photograph I took in London. I release any
    copyright to the icon to whatever domain it needs to be in for it to be
    used in sipXezPhone.

END
