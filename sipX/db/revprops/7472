Add a test to the start script to check for /etc/sipxpbx/*.NEW files,
which have about the same unfortunate features as *.rpmnew files, but
are only generated by the build system, not RPM installs.
(This should be tested more before being checked in, but I need to get
it into the repository before I can merge it into my SIPfoundry Main
working copy.)
