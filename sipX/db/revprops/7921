Make it possible for status server and voicemail to work with multiple domains
(TUI only).

- Modified mailbox manager to use the correct realm when looking up mailbox
identities for virtual domains.
- Modified the mailbox storage functions to create separate subdirectories under
the root mailstore directory for each domain.  User mailboxes are now stored in
the  directory of the domain they belong to, not the top level mailstore, eg.
mailstore/example.com/200 instead of mailstore/200
- Added additional domain parameter to login VXML and CGIs so the voicemail app
can determine which domain to log in and retrieve messages for.
- Changed subscribe server to challenge subscribe requests with the realm
corresponding to the domain of the resource in the request uri.  Modified
message waiting plugin to use the address in the subscribe request uri and not
the auth user when creating subscriptions for mailbox identities.  This makes it
possible to subscribe to and send notifications for the mailbox state of any
configured domain.
- Changed vxml scripts to not quote comparisons to javascript undefined property

TODO: Make more of the voicemail functions work for multiple domains (only
deposit and retrieve work so far).
