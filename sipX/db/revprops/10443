Link codec plugins with libtool -module flag so that it can be properly
dlopened.

Since -module is now used, 'lib' does not need to be a prefix for the codec
plugin .so files, so this also incorporates changes to generate all plugins
as: codec_*.so

Fix the way plugins are installed in the sipXmediaLib/bin directory (maintain
the targets to copy and clean within each plgxxx Makefile.am instead of in the
parent 'codecs' directory)

Change to statically link speex codec to speex codec plugin.  NOTE: This is
NOT portable (libtool even reports this).  It may potentially be portable
if the static speex lib that is linked to is built with -fPIC -DPIC, but
libtool will still complain about it (it has been partially tested).

Correct a few typos.
