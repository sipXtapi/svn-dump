Fix XCS-56.  The sipdb relocation machinery for testing was incomplete, fastdb was still referencing the default directory.  Fix this in SIPDBManager by overriding the fastdb "keyFileDir" variable, *only* if the env var SIPX_DB_VAR_PATH is set.  Since this env var should seldom be set in production installs, this is a pretty safe change.
