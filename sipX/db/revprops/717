Remove swapping of to/from in setNotifyData (let caller do it)
This fixes dialog handling for NOTIFY messages per
  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPS-13
(also untabify SipMessage)

Clean up log error message - Read failure on socket
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-40
This was actually not worth logging - it happens normally when client
sockets are being garbage collected.  Removed the log entry entirely.

Added release notes for 2.6.1

(merged from 2.6)
