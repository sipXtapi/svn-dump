Merged out from main:

    XCF-873 added event driven service restarting support to SipxProcessContext
    instead of calling manageService to restart services it is now possible to call restartOnEvent which will delay the restart until a specific even is received
    added DialPlanActivatedEvent - dial plan context publishes this even after dial plan is activated
    since SipxReplicationContext has lazy implementation there it now has a publishEvent method that ensures that event is published only after replication has been completed
