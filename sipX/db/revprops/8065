Fix race condition in OsTimer:
If the application side of OsTimer::stop() has executed on a periodic
timer before it fires, but the resulting message to OsTimerTask is
processed after it fires, assert(current) fails in
OsTimerTask::removeTimer().
Also, improve the documentation of OsTimerTask::fireTimer(), add a
(messy) test to show this race condition has been fixed, remove all
uses of OsTimer::mDeleting when NDEBUG is #define'd (except
initializing it when the OsTimer is allocated).
This fixes XPB-630.
