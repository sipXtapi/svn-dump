NT-95 
1. Statistics about abandoned calls where missing because query looked at pickup time which would never be set, should be looking at terminate time
2. Add descriptions and help text about the report information in general and many reports for data that may not be obvisous
3. Fix report on total signed-in time, was much higher than it should have been due to a grouping across SQL join than cannot work in one SQL command.  I had to split agent total signin time into a separate report called 'Agent Availablity Summary' to which I added max sign in time.
4. Separate statistics about queue calls summary across 3 reports, calls that were answered and not answered, then finer level of details about answered and unansered into respective reports.  Again, limitation of grouping data across a join
