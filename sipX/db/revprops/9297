Revamp MpStreamPlaylistPlayer to support unlimited number of prompt entries.

Previous version used a fixed sized array, with a MAX of 40 prompts.
This isn't big enough for some of the existing VoiceXML scripts
(dial by name, for example).  Rather than just making it bigger, I
reworked the code to use a UtlSList instead of an array. 

Fixes XPB-245 (When dialbyname finds too many matches, sometimes, the transfer
using dialbyname doesn't complete.)
