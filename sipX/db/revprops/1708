 Removed bRegister flag from sipxLineAdd.
 Added a new method:  sipxLineRegister.

This was needed to work around a race condition caused
by calling sipxLineAdd (with bRegister = true), and then
calling sipxLineAddCredential.

This will break existing sipXtapi client code.

The proper order is now:

1.  sipxLineAdd
2.  sipxLineAddCredential
3.  sipxLineRegister





END
