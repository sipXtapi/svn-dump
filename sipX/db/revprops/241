Put sipxportlib.spec.in in the tarball rather than sipxportlib.spec.
I'm doing this for uniformity w.r.t. all the other components.  Putting
sipxportlib.spec in seems to work for sipXportLib, but it doesn't work for
the other components.  We need to investigate how the build system
handles the inital step of constructing the .spec file to solve this.
