- changes to upgrade to log4j 1.2.9 - sipXconfig was using quite old log4j: it was incompatible with the one used by current JBoss
- postgres JDBC library turned out to be incompatible as well - it is upgraded to lib/pg74.215.jdbc3.jar
- many small changes to build files - to reference new J2EE libraries - they are now in different directories than in old JBoss
- modifications to component managed persistence - while we stay with CMP 1.x for now, JBoss 4.x does not offer jaws (O/R mapper) any more, we need to support jbosscmp-jdbc mechanism, this is responsible for several changes (mostly in finder definitions) in ejb-jar.xml
- all XML descriptor files use current DTDs distributed with JBoss - that should allow for running sipXconfig even without connection to DTDs published on the WEB
- login mechanism changes - custom login module SIPxchange LoginModule has been upgraded
- custom optimizations to EJB configurations in jboss.xml were largely JBoss 2.4 specific - they were temporarily removed
- minor exception handling changes - in many places sipXconfig code was catching (and ignoring or repackaging with information loss) all exceptions including runtime exceptions - this made quite impossible to diagnose problems related to upgrade; in several places code was rewritten to catch only checked exceptions
- minor EJB related problems - classes lacking default constructors or not enabled for marshaling (serializing)
- custom tags that reference unused classes had to be removed
- there is a new JNDI binding for QueueConnectionFactory - it's now called ConnectionFactory
- upgrades to progfilegenerator.sh(.in) start up script - to run the latest JBoss 4.x
- a new environment variable you can set JBOSS_SERVER_CONF if you want to run several separate configurations without installing separate copies of JBoss
