Fix XCF-798: media server and status server are restarting soon after PBX starts, every time.  Ensure that restarts happen at the scheduled date.  There was a bug where that date could be in the past, causing immediate execution of the restart to catch up.  That bug is now fixed.
Also change the Whacker to restart only the media server and not the status server, since the status server no longer has a memory leak.
