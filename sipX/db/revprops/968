Allow header/query parameters ( ?param=val&param2=val )
  even when not in angle brackets.  This is more liberal than
  RFC 3261 requires, but isn't ambiguous so I think it's safe.

Force angle brackets when constructing a URL string if there
  are header/query parameters (be strict in what we send).

Add support for mailto URLs (with the above change it was easy)

  I think that this fixes [XPR-61]
