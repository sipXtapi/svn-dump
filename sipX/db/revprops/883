Revise subscribe-dialog-test to make output file names unique (so logs never
write over older logs).
Add TAG feature so logs can be labeled in a comprehensible way.
Make names of temporary files start with "temp.".
Add subscribe-dialog-test to the bin_SCRIPTS list so it will be put in the
tarballs and RPMs.

END
