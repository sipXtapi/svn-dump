If HAVE_SSL is off (if SSL is not configured in), then attempts to
open SSL listening sockets and connections will fail (and log messages
at level CRIT), rather than silently falling back to unencrypted TCP.

(Mardy and I have probably been held up two days by this problem, as
HAVE_SSL was accidentally turned off in sipXpublisher, so we need to
fix the code to make it fail sensibly in this situation.)
