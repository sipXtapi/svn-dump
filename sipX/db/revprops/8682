XCF-1390 moved and renamed sipxproxy-cdr.wsdl - it now resides in sipXconfig as meta/sipxcallresolver.wsdl
sipXconfig is the only component of the system that requires this .wsdl file (SOAP server that we use does not support serving WSDL yet)
in future we need a better strategy for sharing .wsdl - in general case they need to be available both for servers and clients, at the moment we take advantage of the fact that other SOAP servers live in sipXconfig project
