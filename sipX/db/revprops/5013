Fix XCF-555. Trying to add a hunt group with a name or extension that is used by an existing hunt group is now handled gracefully with an error message on the web page.
Go beyond this immediate problem to add uniqueness constraints for all "name" columns, except for dialing_rule, which we are not prepared to deal with yet.
