[XCS-66] fix shared memory and semaphore leaks
         The sipXcommserverLib and sipXregistry unit tests leaked
         system shared memory and shared semaphore references.  This
         sometimes caused repeated builds to either hang or fail.
         A registrar restart could also cause a similar leak, but in a
         running system this is rare enough not to be a problem unless
         the registrar was deliberately restarted many times (not a
         normal event).

END
