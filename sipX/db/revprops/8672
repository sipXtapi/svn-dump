Make event publishing and subscription mechanisms agree on resource URI.

In 3.6, the "resource IDs" used in the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY presence events 
were all psuedo URIs without the sip:

In 3.7, some of the resources became real URIs WITH the sip:, but some
did not, causing mismatches.

This change makes all of the contacts use sip: so they all agree.

Completes XSL-148 "Event publishing mechanisms should use full URIs as "resource IDs"

--Woof!
