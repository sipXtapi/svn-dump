Simplified access to Spring beans from Tapestry pages.

Instead of global.sipXconfigContext.getBean("dialPlanManager") one can just write global.dialPlanManager
Also streamlined the way applicationContext gets injected into globals. 
We are now overwriting createGlobal (which gets called once) functions instead of setupForRequest (which is called for every request).
