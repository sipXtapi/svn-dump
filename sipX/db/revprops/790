fix for XPH-61.  
The removeMessageObserver method was changed so
 that it specifically removes by reference and then 
 deletes the object.  It had been calling UtlHashBag::destroy,
 which removes by comparison - and removes the first item matching
 the given key.  It was destroying the wrong 
 observer.
