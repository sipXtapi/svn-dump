Make the registry build on windows:
  Fixed portablity issues with the reference to
  system time by using OsTime and OsDateTime methods.

  Fixed initialization of static members so that memory
  is allocated for the member and the static is initialized
  at startup.

  Fixed the windows build so that it include all of the
  classes need to build the registry.

  Use a enum in switch case statement with requires a
  constant.
