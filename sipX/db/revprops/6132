[XRR-83] Document configuration of High Availablity
         Second draft of HA setup instructions
         Added commented-out examples to the configuration files that
           must be editted.
         Added sipx-dns script for generating DNS configuration records.
         Added validation of watchdog.xml
         Fixed a bug in xml file validation that caused some errors to
           be lost.
