  mergefrom pingtel-main 7525
  
  Copy improved definition of OsTimer::compareTimes from Pingtel Main.
  Improved debugging messages on timer system:
  Put in some additional checks that the objects on which the OsTimer
  methods are call are really OsTimers.
  Only report on a slow timer firing routine if it takes more than 1
  sec.  (Because nearly 100 msec is seen routinely even in lightly
  loaded systems.)
  Only report on messages processed by SipUserAgent::handleMessage if
  its queue exceeds 100 messages.
