XCF-1407 add ability to localize enumeration labels in sipXconfig setting files
Enumeration type label keys have to be added to .properties file coresponding to the model in which types are used (usually phone.properties or line.properties)
sipXconfig will use the value from .xml file in the label key is not found.
Label key can be constructed in couple ways
(1) from type id - type.{type id}.{option value}
(2) from explicit 'labelKeyPrefix' - {labelKeyPrefix}.{option value}
(3) from the name of the setting for which type is used - {full setting name}.label.{option value} 
check wiki for examples
