Fixed some sipXtackLib unit tests, masked off others for linux.
  There is some difference between linux and windows that is
  manifesting in the order of destructors and some other threading
  problems.  Created XSL-150, XSL-151, and XSL-152 to track them.

Changed OsStunDatagramSocket and OsStunAgentTask to prevent the
  task object from being deleted while there are still sockets
  that are holding pointers to it.

Made OsSocket a UtlContainable so that all sockets can be stored
  in UtlContainers.

Added documentation to UtlVoidPtr directing developers to
  UtlContainableAtomic as a better alternative.

Fixed a number of warnings under gcc4 on linux
