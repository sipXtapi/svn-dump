Major refactoring of SdpBody to move codec comparison to sdpLib and start of support of true m line independent codec negotiation.
Started to use SdpMediaLine container to support multi m line negotiation and fix bug where m line order was not preserved when
there were multiple m lines (besides simple 1 audio and 1 video m line).

NOTE: This check in breaks:
  RTP/TCP
  ICE candidate parsing and handling in the SDP
  SRTP crypto key handling in the SDP

This features will be fixed in subsequent checkins

END
