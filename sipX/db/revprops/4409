Test whether the voice mail box has an e-mail notification address
before testing whether SMTP_SERVER is set or not.  Thus, if no user
has an e-mail notification address, mediaserver_cgi.log will not
report that SMTP_SERVER is not set.  (And this should be the case --
the Web UI will not let users set e-mail notification if SMTP_SERVER
is not set.)
Also, lower the logging level of "sendEmailNotification : End reached"
to DEBUG from ERR.
