in MpInputDeviceManager::disableDevice, when trying to acquire a device, 
break out of the mutex acquire loop if a device is not valid, or not in use.
It is now more simplified, and description is provided for the #times through.
10ms wait time now used, as resolution of clocks generally isn't any higher
than this.

Fix some compiler warnings (unsigned/signed, precision) in
MpInputDeviceManagerTest.
