A number of changes to the sipXtapi API:

- Removed a number of redundant settings/variables passed to the sipxInitialize method.  These settings are obtainable else where.
- Add the regression test (sipXtapiTest) to the workspace.
- The sipXtapiTest regression tests now working again.  Code was changed in both the lib and the tests.
- sipXtapiInternal.cpp attempts to conform to coding standards.
- I moved the handle mapping/allocation logic into a class
- Regenerated documentation
