Get suspend/resume mechanism working, especially implement the
resumeRequest method.
Implement the "private storage managed by SipRedirectServer" scheme.
Construct SipRedirectorTest, the testing redirector.
Create redirector-test-suspend (out of redirector-test) to exercise
suspend/resume.
Correct that I was using two names for the "redirection resume"
message type, RESUME_MSG and REDIRECT_RESUME.
Implement createCopy for RedirectResumeMsg.
Move a few of the definitions around to avoid circular dependencies
between the .h files.
Create the SipRedirectServer::getInstance method so asynchronous code
can find the RedirectServer to invoke its methods.  (Maybe we should
replace this with passing in a pointer to the calling RedirectServer.)
Pass the redirector number to the redirector when calling various of
its methods.
Delete obsolete declarations of registrationDBLookUp, aliasDBLookUp,
and urlMappingDBLookUp.
Begin documenting the possibility of a redirector signaling during its
initialization that it will do no work and can be ignored.
