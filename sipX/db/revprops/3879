XCF-369 removing users fails in some cases (when users have Polycom lines or custom forwarding)
- added onUserDelete notification that allows neoconf module to clean up user related artifacts when user is deleted
- notification is called (via RMI) from UserAdvocate.deleteUser function
- new "clean" methods in PhoneContext and FrowardingContext
- relevant unit tests added
