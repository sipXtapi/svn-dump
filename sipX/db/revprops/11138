Add a sipx_abs_srcdir Autoconf substitution.
abs_srcdir (provided by default from autoconf) is not enough -- it is 
properly specified from the root of the filesystem (/) but it can (and often
does) include relative bits within it.

sipx_abs_srcdir corrects this, providing a full absolute path, without any
relativity in it.

This was added for use in stripping path prefixes when generating Doxygen
documentation, which will be checked in shortly.
