XML snippets from the database were incorrectly incorporated in XML document, which caused problems if data contained some reserved cahracters (such as &, >, <).
After this change we operate on JDOM XML trees directly. 
This is a quick and dirty fix to elimate serious problem: the very concept of storing XML blobs in the database is flawed and needs to be removed from sipXconfig.
