Revise how Call-IDs are generated so that multiple applications on a
single host cannot produce duplicate Call-IDs.
This is issue http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XCL-51.
This includes importing the UtlLongLongInt implementation.

Make the generated Call-IDs a little shorter by hashing all the fixed
fields with MD5 and using only the first 16 hex characters.
Make CpCallManager::getNewCallId(const char*, UtlString*) static,
since it doesn't depend on any member variables, and it could be used
by anybody to generate Call-IDs.

END
