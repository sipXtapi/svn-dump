Fix some bugs in MprBufferRecorder.
* enable() now operate as usual, sending message to resource and doing everything in handleEnable();
* buffer capacity is now set correctly - previously it may cause memory corruption;
* recorder state is set to FINISHED on the same processing interval after buffer was filled.
