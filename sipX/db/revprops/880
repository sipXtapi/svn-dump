Clean up building with (or without) SIP TLS support
  TLS isn't working yet, but the build is better.
Cleaned up lots of logging an added some disabled logging for connection managment tracking
Removed quite a bit of commented-out code and reindented stuff that
  had been poorly converted from tabs.

Fixed XSL-58
    http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-58
    This is now dealt with correctly in SipClient::sendTo
