XCF-1171 intergrated Douglas patch to finish selecting new and existing gateways from drop-down list
numerous changes to GatewaysPanel to make it self-contained - it does not require any listeners to be passed from the container
fix old problems with PatternEditor used in custom gateways (it was adding/removing patterns even if errors were reported)
minor updates to TestUtils - better check for validator and for "rewind" stage

END
