Move a couple of classes to be subclasses of UtlContainableAtomic
rather than UtlContainable.
Update a bunch of classes to use the class::getContainableType() and
class:TYPE members according to our conventions.

Correct how GRUUs are generated.
Fix how libsipXcommserverTest.la is searched for, so it can be found
even when it is not installed.
