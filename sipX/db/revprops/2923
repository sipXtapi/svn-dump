Start of changes to get core dumps produced when we want them.
This is a revision of the signal handling code in sipXvxml.  Unknown
signals are caught and logged, but then the signal handler sends a
SEGV to itself to cause a core dump to be produced.
(Core dumps are suppressed by default, via SIPX_CORELIMIT=0 in
config.defs.  But that is enforced by the ulimit mechanism.)
Unfortunately, this doesn't work for sipXvxml, because it runs setuid,
and the kernel won't write core dumps for setuid processes.
