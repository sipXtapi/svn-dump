Clarify the reason for an unsupported encoding error
This was inspired by a problem seen at SIPit15; an overzealous
implementation included 'Content-Encoding: identity' in the request,
which caused a 'Bad Media' response.  The 'identity' token is not
defined in that header (only in the corresponding Accept-Encoding
header).
This was the right error code to send, but the text expansion was
not clear.
