Fix longstanding bug in testRecordPlayback -- buffer to record to was 500x bigger than it needed to be (5000 seconds, when it needed to be 10secs)
Due to this:
  * record was fine, as you pass in #millisecs to record
  * Playback plays back audio
  * Playback FINISHED event never occurs before the timeout we specify to look for it in (15secs), as MprFromFile is still playing back the end of the zeroed buffer.

Now buffer is the proper size.
END
