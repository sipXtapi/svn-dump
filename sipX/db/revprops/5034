Finish fixing XCF-357: Disallow gateways, auto attendants, and park orbits with duplicate names.  In this checkin, handle creating auto attendants with duplicate names gracefully.
Also: rename DialPlanManager to DialPlanContextImpl for consistency with other context beans. Clean up a bunch of typos and confusion in UI text.
