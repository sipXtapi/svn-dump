UtlHashMap::destroy documentation was not clear as to whether you needed the
actual key itself in order for it to destroy the entry matching the key passed
in, or if a UtlContainable that equals ( operator== ) the key is sufficient.

I ran a few tests, and determined that it is the latter, and now am committing
changes to the doxygen documentation to make that clear.
