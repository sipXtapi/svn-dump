Created MSVS2019 solution file for sipX
sipXportLib, sipXsdpLib, sipXtackLib and sipXmediaLib and their sub-projects have been migrated
With the exception of some of the codec plugins and perhaps some mediaLib contrib projects
Still needs to have sipXcallLib and other projects migrated to MSVS2019

END
