A number of media processing bug fixes and some code clean up:

- Added stubs for setGain/getGain under Windows
- Fixed a bug where setting the volume ONLY changed the "ringer" 
  device as opposed to the in-call device.   This was only an issue
  when a different audio device were used for ringer/in-call.
- Removed uninteresting console output (osPrintf)
- Reformatted some code blocks to conform with coding conventions
  (and readability).
- Only allow once instance of the MicThread and SpkrThread to run
  per process.  This change is required in order to run multiple 
  CallManager/UA instances within the same process space (very
  useful for testing).
