Correct voicemail "e-mail" notifications

Use UTF-8 and 8bit transport for MIME parts.  This enables non-ascii
characters and corrects a bug where links in the HTML part would not
work in Opera and Entourage (due to quoted-printable transfer encoding
mucking up parameters, e.g. mailbox=0001 would be converted into mailbox(NULL)
because the quoted-printable transport uses the =NN escape sequence, and
the HTML was not escaped correctly)

Only send one e-mail on forwarded messages, with the merged comment and
forwarded message included.  Previously two e-mails were sent, one with
just the comment (empty if there was no comment), and one with the merged
content.

Cleaned up the code so it was more readable (to me, anyway).

--Woof!
