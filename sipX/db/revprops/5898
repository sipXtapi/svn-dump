[XRR-91] Return only contacts for the same call-id for REGISTER
 We've seen too many phones that don't expect to see contacts other than the
one they sent, and get upset by contact parameters meant for others In
particular, when some other contact is about to expire, they think that
they got a short time and try again - which loops until the other contact
expires or is refreshed by someone else - not good.

Return the contacts set by the same call-id if any were set.

If the REGISTER did not contain contacts, it is a query - so return them all.
