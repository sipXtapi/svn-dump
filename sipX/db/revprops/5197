XCF-667 remove JobManager, instead BackgroundTaskQueue as a base for JobQueue
each phone job (propagate and restart) is treated now as a separate task and can be potentially executed in a separate thread, failure of a single job does not affect other jobs or sipXconfig itself
XCF-677 fix for Generate All Profiles button - it was attached to the wrong listener

END
