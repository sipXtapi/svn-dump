Fix TLinkedList so that it IS thread-safe, instead of just LOOKING thread-safe.

There were two problems:
  (1) All iteration operations were always followed by calls to AddRef, and
  those AddRefs all need to be done atomically with the GetFirst/GetNext.
  (2) If thread A was in a loop iterating over a list and thread B called
  GetFirstEntry or RemoveFirstEntry for that same list, the iterator
  variable got stomped on which pretty much kicked thread A in the nuts.

Now, the caller must take the list's lock before beginning an iteration
sequence, and keep it until done iterating.  This fixes both problems.
