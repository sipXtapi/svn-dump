[XPB-499] Changes to build and install on FC5
          Many changes to compile with gcc 4
           (thank you Hannu Strang for most of these)
          Several changes to the configuration macros to detect other
           differences
          Upgrade the dependent packages to later versions
          Trim and configure the apache configuration files so that
           I think they now work with either 2.0 or 2.2
