Added unit test for testing multiple m lines.  Still more work to do.  I found an interesting bug while working on this: If you create an SdpBody with no arguments and then populate, the accessor method do not always work.  In my case, a blank "c=" line was added as part of the default constructor which broke the getMediaAddress(int, UtlString*) method.  This was fixed by created a new SdpBody and initializing it with the rendered content from the original one.
