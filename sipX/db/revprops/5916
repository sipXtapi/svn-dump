Defined the internal methods in RegistrarInitialSync that are the
   statup phase steps.
Implemented SyncRpcReset::invoke
 (client side of registrarSync.reset XML-RPC method)
Re-ordered a couple of things in SipRegistrar initialization
 to get the dependencies correct.
Changed a couple of interfaces to always pass the primary name
 as a const char* (we won't normally be manipulating these, so this is
   easier than passing UtlString)
