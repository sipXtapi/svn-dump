Re-add isShutDown() call to MpInputDeviceManagerTest, as ackShutdown is called
when threadEntry task is complete, however, false was received for isShutdown
because of race condition - where isShutdown call was called after the unit
test past it's signal at the end of the run() routine, but before ackShutdown
was called.

To fix, made a public wrapper for waitUntilShutDown(), and called it first,
waiting maximum of a second for completion.  Then the isShutdown() check
is made.


END
