Support for GSM 6.10 13 kbit/s codec added.
It use libgsm (http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/toast.html) for decoding/encoding.

Codec enabled under Windows only. If you do not want this - remove HAVE_GSM from preprocessor definitions and gsm[d].lib from input libraries.

Patch was originally written by Andrzej Ciarkowski, then changed by me to conform sipXtapi codec interface.
