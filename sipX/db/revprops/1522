Make the message that call state log information was lost not
conditionally compiled, although it is still at DEBUG level.
Put the timestamp on the call state log lines at the beginning, and
use the same format as ordinary log messages, so they can be sorted
together.  (Though these timestamps have 000000 for microseconds.)
Correct the formatting of some lines.
