Fix bug in G.711 A-law encoder, causing annoying audible noise in case of very quite noise present in source.
When sound itself is inaudible, but cause a lot of zero-crossing, a lot of audible clicks were produced,
because values in [-7; -1] were coded to wrong value, decoded to -248 then.

Interesting, that this bug seems to be very old and common - I found that it comes from original public
domain code from Sun Microsystems Inc., and, I guess, may be found in many other open-source and proprietary
applications.
