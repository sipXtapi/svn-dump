XCF-753 conference bridge UI tests fixed
- problem with Upload parameter - created StieTestHelper:initUploadFields to help us deal with HTTPUnit/Tapestry incompatibility
- there are some problems with default values for integer settings not being displayed - marked with FIXME:
- TablePAnel component relied on getXXXBinding automatically created - Tapestry 4 does not provide it any more, one has to call getBinding("xxx")

END
