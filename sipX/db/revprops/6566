XCF-994 This problem was introduced during upgrade to Tapestry 4. We gave up then on id converters and started using global squeezers. 
SearchPhoneTableModel was incorrectly using squeezer to load found phones from the database. In this context it does not make sense to use squeezer at all. I replaced it by explicitely loading phones using phone context.
Also - minor Eclipse warnings fixed.
