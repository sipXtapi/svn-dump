Factor checkPeers loop out of message handling routine so that it can
  also be called once unconditionally at the transition into
  operational phase.
Factor resetTimer out so that it can be called from both the check
  method and from checkPeers
Replace the mTimerIsRunning boolean with a 4-state enum that better
  expresses the different modes
