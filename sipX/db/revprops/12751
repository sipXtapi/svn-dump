Fixed a bunch of bugs identified by the MprRecorder unit test:
  + Clear the Opus encoder stream when we drain it.
  + Added Opus OGG validation for append case.
  + Added method to validate Opus OGG file header.
  + Added logging to track all opens and closes of recrod files.
  + Set Opus OGG encoder family to 255 (non-standard mapping) for 3 and 4 channel recordings.
  + Made Opus encoder stream buffer size proportional to number of channels.
