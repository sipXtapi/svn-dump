Make defaults more prominent, using preprocessor definitions to define them (default silence length, default frames to record).
Clean up formatting. (still needs some tab removal)
Add description esp. including parameter description for CpMediaInterface::recordMic, as it is not obvious that silence length is in seconds, whereas the record time is in milliseconds.
