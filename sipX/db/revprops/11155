Changes:

1) Fixed a bug that caused early termination (via SILENT events) of
   calls (related the monitor task / socket last read/write state)
2) Failed to send VQMon reports when using ARS (looked at wrong socket
   for first/last read/write times)
3) Added verbose debugging options in the CpMediaMonitorTask to dump
   state on all manipulators (including timer handler) -- disabled by
   default, see source for #define
3) Don't drop video packets if the socket is full, instead block on
   each write -- more work is required here (e.g. smarter drop alg
   that doesn't toss key frames).
4) [GIPS only] Fixed bug where audio RTCP packets dropped by GIPS
   (incorrect channel id passed in API)
5) [GIPS only] Set max MTU size to 1200 to avoid UDP fragmentation
6) [GIPS only] Turn on some of the new GIPS features including
   bandwidth throttling via RTCP reports -- GIPS should automatically
   lower the bitrate if it detects delays or excessive packet loss).
7) [GIPS only] Added the ability to display and override camera images
   during connection and when no camera is available
