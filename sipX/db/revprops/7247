XCF-1121 refactor permssion related code to prepare for dynamic updates to call permission list: Permission class is no longer Enumeration (cannot be updated dynamically) - however it behaves in a similar manner (equals and hashCode defined properly)
new permission manager introduced - empty implmentation does not save custom permissions in DB yet
addional bonus: since Permission now has label and description (it's created from Setting definition) we have user readable permission labels in Dial Plan UI

END
