- Updated installation instructions for building on Windows.
  It should be easier to figure out what to install for glib
  and PCRE
- Use Multithreaded DLL and Debug Multithreaded DLL runtime
  libraries instead of the non-DLL versions.  This results in 
  smaller executables, but more importantly works with binary
  distributions of PCRE and glib.
