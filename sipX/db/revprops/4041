Merge changes from 2.8
  Add CONFIGURE_OPTIONS configuration variable to the set available in LocalizeSipXconfig.
  Add --configopts argument to all <project>-config installation record scripts.

  This allows the options that were passed to configure at build time to be available
  later at run time.

  (this generalizes a mechanism Dale added to the rpm builds some time ago)
