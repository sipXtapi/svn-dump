Don't remove sipXtapi INFO context if we resend the INFO for authentication challenge and don't access NULL INFO context if its not found.
If an INFO is chalenged for authentication, and the INFO was sent via sipXtapi 
(i.e. it has an INFO data structure associated with the transaction) we need to keep
the INFO data around until the resend INFO request gets a response.  Previously the
INFO data was deleted when the response was recieved for the intial INFO request.
Then when the response was recieved for the INFO resent with auth credentials a
SEGV occurred when accessing the NULL INFO data structure (i.e. not found as it was
deleted).

END
