Replace old automake INCLUDES construct with AM_CPPFLAGS in mpcodecs also had to change LTLIBRARIES target dir due to conflict in automake 1.13.
Note this could break some build scripts that installed codecs using the make install-pkgdataLTLIBRARIES target.
The make target has been renamed to: install-mpcodecsLTLIBRARIES
Apologies for the inconvenience/distruptions caused by this change.  I have not found an alternative that I can make autotools work with.
