Fix bug XCF-696: Replace Apache DBCP jar with C3P0 jar in build.xml.
Remove the property dataSource.url from sipconfig.properties.in.  Having switched to C3P0, the new property should be dataSource.jdbcUrl.  But this is redundant with applicationContext-sipconfig.xml, which already defines this property, so just remove it from sipconfig.properties.in rather than fixing it.
