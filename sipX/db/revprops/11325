Must use codec sample rate not flowgraph sample rate to initialize AGV adn VAD.
Cannot initialize AGC and VAD in MpJitterBuffer::init as we only know the
flowgraph sample rate at that time.  Need to wait for the first packet to
get the specific payload type and determine sample rate for AGV and VAD initialization.
