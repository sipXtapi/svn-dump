Merging in from main up to rev 6317

[XPB-530] Workaround.
  Change the default for the address in the Record-Route header
  inserted by the authproxy to explicitly use the ip address and port.
  This is only a change of how the value is constructed, not an actual
  change in the value.  In earlier revisions, the config.defs variable
  AUTH_PROXY_SERVER_SIP_SRV_OR_HOSTPORT was used, but its value was
  set to ${MY_IP_ADDR}:${AUTH_PROXY_SERVER_SIP_PORT}.  With the HA
  changes, an actual SRV name is used in config.defs.  Due to XPB-530,
  the forking proxy does not correctly route messages that use an SRV
  name in the Route header, so this checkin changes the authproxy to
  always use what it did before.

XCF-941 Pick different setting names for line and phone dial plans.  THIS WILL remove all dial-plan line settings, but they didn't work right to begin with

Add sample SOAP script from Perl

XCF-903 conditionally display additional column ("Primary registrar") on a Registrations page
It is only usable if you have HA configured: it displays the name of the registrar that initially handled registration.
