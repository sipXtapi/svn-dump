-reduced solution configurations to just Release and Debug - list got polluted over time, thanks to visual 
 studio adding solution configurations whenever you add a new project to the solution
-organized solution with solution directories
-added x64 project configurations for all projects
-made all projects use the same two settings for OutDir and IntDir - this avoids collisions when compiling with different configurations
  <OutDir>$(SolutionDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\</OutDir>
  <IntDir>$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\</IntDir>
  -this also simplifies the need to copy around dll files, since binaries end up in the same directory
-removed -msvc16 from the target names of the projects to allow use of the following outputfile setting for all projects 
  <OutputFile>$(OutDir)$(TargetName)$(TargetExt)</OutputFile>
-PCRE library inclusion improvements
  -added sipXportLib/contrib/pcre - which greatly simplifies the windows build, since you don't need to manually go get pcre 
  -removed include of pcre.h from header file, so that all projects do NOT need an include path the pcre header files, 
   only sipXportLib and mstream need it now
  -pcre is now statically linked to sipXportLib, removing the need to have pcreX.dll in your in directory, removed post build steps  
   that were copying this file
-added VS2019 project files for l16 and opus codecs 
-modified the opus projects to be statically linked instead of dlls' to avoid need to copy around dll's 
-use DLL versions of C-runtime for all projects
-fixed build issue with missing forward declaration in MpodWinMM
-removed linker settings from PlgGsm.c - use project dependencies to handle automatically instead
-mstream.cpp now includes pcre.h, since it no longer comes along with UtlRegex.h
