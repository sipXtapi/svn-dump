XCF-891 exporting CDRs to CSV file
- new method (dumpCdrs) in CdrManager - using CsvWriter to directly stream CDRs to writer objects
- new Tapestry service (ExportService) that works similary to direct service but does not render the page after listerner is invoked - it is used to implement export listener that is solely responsible for rendering entire response (for example creating response as CSV file)
- modifications on CdrStatsPanel to add export link
