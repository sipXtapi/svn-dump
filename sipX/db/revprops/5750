For XRR-73 (Db/sipdbtest change), enhance DisplayTask::showTableRows to show the new primary and update_number values for registrations.  (Yes, I marked this JIRA entry as resolved but then realized there was more work to do.)
Also break up showTableRows into lots of smaller routines, for maintainability. Delete an entire duplicate copy of the 20+ lines of code that print out registrations.
