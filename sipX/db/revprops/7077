Clean up failed error transfer processing in Auto Attendant
After three attempts with either no DTMF input, or an invalid extension 
is entered, the AA has the ability to transfer to a provisoned extension.  
If THAT provisioned extension is invalid, the call flow now correctly 
informs the caller than an error occurred and hangs up.
Fixes http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XVX-171 (In AA, When Invalid 
responce[sic] is set, does not work properly)
--Woof!

commented out the testActivateDefaultAttendant test
it depended on autoattendant.vm, stopped working after woofs changes
need to rewrite the test - use internally provided .vm file or fix stylesheet used to compare the results to make it less volatile

END
