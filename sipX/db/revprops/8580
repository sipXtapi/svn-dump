XCF-1066 - Use velocity and jdom/xpath instead of xstream for reading mailbox preferences.  Tipping point was when I couldn't get xstream to read both text inside an element and attributes on the element.  (notification/contact has attributes and text content).  xstream should only be used if you control to xml format, period.

I'm tempted to go back and redo voicemail descriptor read/write.  I think it would be a bit simpler.
