Fix signatures of OsConfDb methods so that non-modifying methods can
apply to const objects.  Add mutable members and adjust method
implementations.
Fix routine that parses config file lines to allow whitespace (but not
require it) where people expect.
Allow comment lines (rather than just as a side effect of failing to
parse them).
Report config file line syntax errors at CRIT level.
Add test for config file parsing method.
Re-code OsConfigDb::getSubHash to be more efficient, and allow a const
base object.
