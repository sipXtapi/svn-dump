Fixed a locking problem where we were taking a read lock instead of a write lock to
create the NetInTask communication and control socket.

Implemented simple short term mic and speaker driver abstraction for posix.
This will have a real plugin in the medium term.

Changed the mediaAdapter unit tests so that the media tasks are not shutdown.  There is
a problem with the media subsystem shutdown that appears to leave the speaker and mic
feeder/reader threads up such that restarting the media subsystem for each test causes
multiple instances of the feeder/readers to exist resulting in bad audio.  Temporarily
we are not going to shutdown the media subsystem between tests.

These changes still have printfs as there is still a audio problem that is being chased
down.
