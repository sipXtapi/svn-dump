Commiting merge from Wince branch r8018 to r8313 (patch provided by Keith
    Kyzivat). 

- sipXtapi unit tests pass on Windows (subscribe tests still need some help)
- sipXportLib tests pass on Windows (except OsProcessMgr tests)
- sipXtackLib tests pass on Windows (except known fatal bugs)
- sipxMediaAd


I made the following additional changes:

1) Removed printfs in NetInTask/friends.  In some cases, I converted
   the printf's back to OsSysLogs.
2) Fixed for sipXtackUnit test (addCodecsOffer changed shape)


END
