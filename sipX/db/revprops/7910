mergefrom user_dworley_redirectors2main 7786,7787,7792,7825,7826

Update Interop configuration.

Remove minor bugs and add minor improvements to redirectors.

Fix display of OK/FAILED after waiting for watchdog to start.
Previous code did not work:
        [ $seconds == 0 ] && echo_failure || echo_success
because echo_failure exits with status 1, so echo_success will also be
executed, writing over the failure message.  One must use the idion:
        [ $seconds != 0 ] && echo_success || echo_failure

Update developer helper files.

Update SipRedirectorGateway, but do not compile it yet, as it's not done.

END
