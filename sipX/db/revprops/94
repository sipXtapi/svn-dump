Fix XPL-14 : require automake 1.8 or greater

   In the course of putting in this check, I found a very useful
   autoconf macro for comparing version numbers: AX_COMPARE_VERSION
   so I added it to our general.m4; use it if you need similar
   checks.

Also put back in the obnoxious warning options for gcc, which had
disappeared.
