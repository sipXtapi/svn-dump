Add wideband support to resource test rig MpGenericResourceTest - to allow sample rates other than the old fixed 8000 samples/sec and samplesPerFrame of 80 to be used in resource tests.

Update tests that used the old method to access the sample rate to the new one.
Currently they all still operate as before, with 8000 samples/sec, and 80 samples/frame, but now can be more easily modified so they can test different sample rates and samples per frame.
