More methods for MpDspUtils implemented:
* Integer shift operations: shl16_I, shl16, shl32_I, shl32.
* Vector arithmetic operations: add, mul.
* Vector methods to convert from 16-bit integers to 32-integers/float (with and without gain/attenuation).
Note, unittests are not implemented for them yet.
