- maven build results are placed in build.maven so that ithey do not conflict with standard build: you can change it by setting top.build.dir property
- a new way of specyfing top.dir variable: use SIPX_SRC to point to main workplace directory (parent of sipXconfig)
- compiler is now properly using source:1.4 and target:1.4 variables to preserve JDK 1.4 compatibility
