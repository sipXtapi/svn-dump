Allow developers to bind/rebind to audio devices under WIN32.

Details:
  - You can now specify a mic device.  Previously, used the 
    matching in-call device.
  - You can now change the audio device after the Speaker
    and Mic threads have been started
  - Move the Speaker & Mic threads into their own source files
  - Folded in changed from Larry Budnick / XMR-19: "allow windows
    based servers to operate with no sound card".  Additionally,
    you can now request "NONE" as an input or output device.
  - Moved some of the global varibles into DmaTask as statics 
    (more cleanup is needed here).
