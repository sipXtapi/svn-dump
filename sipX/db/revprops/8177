Change the timing of the creation of media connections for
incoming calls so that the media connections are not created
until the call is accpeted.  This reduces the resource load and
allows the ability to set properties and resources on the media
connection before the call is set up.

Added release and debug options to MSVC6 build script as the 
MSVC6 project files all support release builds now.
