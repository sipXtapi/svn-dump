XPB-522 disable namespace awarness in DOM4J XML Parser when parsing process.cgi output
ProcessDefinitions.xml has been recently updated to include namespace declaration.
sipXconfig uses XPath expressions that stopped working, which results in empty services screen.
I disabled namespace feature for now since namespace aware Xpath expressions look really ugly.
