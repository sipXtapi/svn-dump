[XRR-80] spread registrations over time to smooth load
  Shorten the granted registration time by a random factor
  such that registrations are spread uniformly over time.
  Normal length requests (for >= twice the minimum) are randomized
  between twice the minimum and the max that we can grant.
  Short requests (for < twice the minimum) are randomized
  between the minimum and the requested amount.
  Minimum length requests are not shortened (that would be
  hypocritical, since we would not accept a request that short).
