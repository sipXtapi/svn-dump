Remove unused definition of assignment operator for
LinePresenceMonitor.
Correct "result = false" to "result = true".
Initialize LinePresenceMonitor::mpDialogMonitor.
Delete reinitialization of CpCallManager::mCallNum, which could cause
  Call-IDs to be duplicated.
Add/improve/correct comments.
Align argument names in LinePresenceMonitor.cpp with those in
  LinePresenceMonitor.h.
Qualify typedef name "Status" so it is clear what module it is from.
Remove unused #define.
Improve debugging messages.
Delete reinitialization of CpCallManager::mCallNum, which could cause
   Call-IDs to be duplicated.
Fix indentation.
Oops, you can't dynamic_cast void* into anything.
Switch the order of two initializers to the order they will be
executed.
Clean up the machinery for Dialog and SipDialogEvent in preparation
for fixing SipDialogMonitor.
Dialogs are now identified by call-Id, to-tag, and from-tag, rather
than call-Id alone, as call-Id is not a unique identifier for dialogs.
SipDialogEvent::getDialog now looks up dialogs based on call-Id and
tags, rather than just tags.  This requires adjustments in
and DialogEventPublisher.cpp.
SipDialogEvent now stores dialogs in a UtlSList rather than a
UtlHashMap, as there are likely to be only a few of them.
Disabled the assignment and copy constructors for these classes, as
nobody seems to be using them, and the implementations were dubious.
Provide method to return an iterator over the dialogs in a
SipDialogEvent, rather than to copy the dialogs into a supplied
UtlHashMap, as this is more efficient and appears to suffice for all
the callers' needs.
Adjust tests.
Overhaul of SipDialogMonitor so it will handle partial updates of
dialog event packages.  Also, handle multiple dialogs reported in one
package, and multiple subscriptions established by one SUBSCRIBE.
Additional tests for SipDialogMonitor, and fixes for the bugs that
they revealed.
Conditionalize OsSysLog activation in SipDialogMonitorTest.
Update the pick-up server to add "?Require=replaces" to the
redirection address.  This will cause pick-ups from UAs that do not
support INVITE with Replaces to fail with a 420 rather than causing
strange behavior.
Adjust SipSubscribeClient::handleNotifyRequest so that it gives the
callback routines the early dialog handle even if there is an
established dialog handle.  This allows the callback routines to
correlate early dialogs with established ones.
Improve the description of addStateChangeNotifier.
Add test for the situation where a NOTIFY arrives after we've stopped
tracking the state for its subscription.
Improve comments on NotifyEventCallback type.
Fix the problem that caused the tests
SipUserAgentTest::testShutdownNonBlocking and
SipUserAgentTest::testShutdownBlocking to fail sometimes.
The threads started by the SipUserAgent et al. do not stop
synchronously with the calls to shut them down, so the test has to
wait a short time before checking whether there are any unexpected
threads running.
Generate the "target" URIs in dialog events correctly by not putting them
in <...>.  Using <...> is syntactically incorrect (they are not part of the
URI), and tinyXML doesn't escape them properly.
Revise LinePresenceMonitor to deal with asynchronous processing much
better.
