- fixes to bbridge VS.NET project files to use resiprocate from sipX/resiprocateLib 
- disable ConfigRPC for windows builds of bbridge, since this eventually pulls in 
  osSSLxxxx stuff which does not yet build nicely under windows
- removed bogus source control bindings from sipXMediaLib, sipXPortLib, and sipXStackLib projects
- added some missing Utl files from sipXPortLib project
