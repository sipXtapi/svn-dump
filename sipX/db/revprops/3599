XCF- Fixing RMI related issue. Adding support for JMS.

Fixes to RMI based Alias service - it cannot be implemented with Spring based RMI invoker, because profilegenerator module does not use Spring [this may change in future]. 
rmic step added in the compilation.
Some preparations to use JMS in order to trigger profilegenerator's datasets push.
RMI and JMS related resources are now initialized in separate Spring context files (this is necessary if we are to support automatic testing of database and UI).
For now JMS resources are not initialized: we need to come up with a way of doing it only inside of EJB container. Otherwise our automatic WEB UI unit tests are not working.
