Plugin framework and Register Plugin improvements.
Clarity improvements to the plugin framework based on comments
  from Dale, Dong, and Lih at the review.
  Changed a couple of the class names, added UML overview to the
  Plugin documentation.
Updated RegisterPlugin support.
Converted the hard-coded support for implied mwi subscriptions
  to a plugin (which is built and installed by default, as before,
  but this way it could be removed, and serves as a working example
  of how to do a RegisterPlugin).
Added unit tests for the implied subscription plugin
  and fixed bugs in the implied subscription requests that the test
  found!
Added a singleton wrapper class for the SipNonceDb
Cleaned up some of the Plugin logging.
