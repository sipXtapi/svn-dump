Call Resolver:
1. Open a connection to the database if one is not already open.  The unit tests rely on Rails to take care of this, but the Call Resolver is not running under Rails.
2. Handle the case where we go to save a CDR and discover that there is already a CDR in the database for this SIP dialog.  But we don't yet support the "redo" flag for recomputing CDRs.  Right now only incomplete CDRs are overwritten.
