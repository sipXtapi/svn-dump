Updated configuration to location of prompts, .vxml scripts etc.  
You will also find some commented out configuration changes related
to file:/// urls.   See voicemail.xml.in.in in my next check-in for
more changes.  I spent way too much time attempting to convert from
http:// urls to file:/// urls for performance reasons.  SBinetURL.cpp
half handles relatively file URLs (looks like by mistake) -- Either we
will need to switch to full file:// urls for root.vxml or I need to
spend more timing to understand if changing SBinetURL is the correct
approach.
