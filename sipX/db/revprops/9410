Fix for memory leak in SipXEventDispatcher::removeListener. It assumed mListeners.destroy will also delete object inside UtlVoidPtr, but UtlVoidPtr only has void* to the object, thus can't delete it. We have to delete the object inside UtlVoidPtr manually.
The same problem was in SipXEventDispatcher::removeAllListeners.
