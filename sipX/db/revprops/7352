Swiss dialplan resides in /etc/sipxpbx/dialplan/ch.dialrules.beans.xml: it has to be manually copied over /etc/sipxpbx/dialplan/ch.dialrules.beans.xml. Chnaging default dialplan requires sipXconfig restart. Default dial plan has to be manually applied by pressing Revert button.
This mechanism can be used to define dial plans for other countries or customized installations.
