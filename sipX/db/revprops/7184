(First test of a branch convergence methodology.)

mergefrom pingtel-main 5128

Add merge-logs.

mergefrom pingtel-main 5836 (partial)

mergefrom pingtel-cml 5511,5530,5552,5558,5622,5624,5625,5635,5647,5650
Add code to handle the --before and --after switches, as the overall
processing time of merge-logs is dramatically faster if --before and
--after are handled in syslog2siptrace rather than in siptrace-merge.
Pass the --before and --after options to syslog2siptrace, now that it
supports them.
Use "--" rather than "-" as the end-of-options marker.

mergefrom pingtel-cml 5701,5702,5712,5717,5722,5753,5782,5787,5788,5789,5790
Change test for "--before" into test for "--after".

mergefrom pingtel-main 6539

Add merge-logs to the bin_SCRIPTS list so it will be installed.
This will help people testing and debugging sipX.

mergefrom pingtel-main 6561

Add both merge-logs and siptrace-merge to EXTRA_DIST

END
