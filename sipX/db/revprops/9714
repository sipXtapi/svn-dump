Added utility class for generic DSP functions, it will be used by resources, which require intensive computations.
It is designed to contain only static functions, usable from everywhere. It is also designed to support floating point and fixed point operations, selectable at compile time.
This class is a good place for platform specific optimizations. In fact, it is supposed to the only place for asm inlines and so on. Generic code should be kept generic and clean.
