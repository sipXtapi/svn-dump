Implemented SipSubscribeServer unit test.  Server now
successfully accepts SUBSCRIBE request.  Give empty
NOTIFY request if no content is available for the
resource.  Sends a new NOTIFY when content is
published for the resource.

Added unit tests for SipSubscribeServerEventHandler
to the SipSubcribeServerTest and
SipPublishContentMgrTest unit tests as the event
handler requires the other classes to be tested
anyway.

Fixed segv in SipSubscribeServerEventHandler when
no content is available for a resource.

Added accessors to SipSubcribeServer to
facilitate easier testing.
