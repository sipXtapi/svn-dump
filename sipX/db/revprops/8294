  Two fixes:
  
  1) SipClients used to give up after 8 'bad packet' reads.  In
     testing, I found that sending a single INVITE (and then
     exiting the sending app / closing the socket) resulted in
     the SipClient closing w/ resends and attempting to cleanup
     the INVITE.  I increased this to 12.  In cases where the
     socket has gone bad, this will still exit fairly quickly.
  
  2) Don't crash/double delete if the m= line includes multiple
     payloads (e.g. "0 8 97 97").
