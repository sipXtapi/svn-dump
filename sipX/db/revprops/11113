Change installation so instead of installing to a fixed directory, it instead
installs to a directory for which the name is created using 'mktemp' to ensure
it is unique.

Prior to this fix, collisions could occur when multiple instances of the
script run at the same time, or even when multiple users of the script on the
same machine run it at different times.

This was witnessed in build failure of the Hudson job:
Linux_sipx-build--CentOS5_x86_64 build #122
