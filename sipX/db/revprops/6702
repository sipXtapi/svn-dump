Merge revs 6686 and 6698 from sipfoundry 3.4

Add actual screen output for stunnel failure connections instead of just
logging and silently failing.
Set correct permissions on stunnel log file so logrotate can work with
it.

XPB-581: Add refer URI to call state event logging, adapt authproxy CSE
observer, unit tests, and database patching to add this column.
