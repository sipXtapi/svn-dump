1)  Added remote DTMF events -- this is implemented somewhat differently from 
    what Dan Petrie did on the main line.
2)  Renamed TONE_ID to SIPX_TONE_ID to better fit in our namespace.

[Needs more testing on my side -- doesn't seem to break anything, but I need
to verify that the events actually work]
