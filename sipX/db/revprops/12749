A bunch of bug fixes and additional logging and checking:
  Log if buffer is not big enough before asserting in opusenc callback
  Made opusenc stream buffer bigger as it was too small
  Set MprRecorder opusenc object pointer so that buffer can be flushed to file
  Don't check if steam buffer is not null if opusenc object (buffer container) is null
  Corrected drain comments
  Enabled opusenc drain
  Use correct buffer to write to file when draining
  Don't write wav header for Opus
  Correct samples written count for Opus to take up/down sampling in consideration
  Fix MprRecorder::wrieFile return code
  Declair and test size of interlace buffer only when its used
  More logging and error reporting in MprRecorder::writeFile
  Set bytesPerSample for Opus case
