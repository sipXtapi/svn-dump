minor changes to allow building and running under IBM JDK 1.5
- GrandstreamPhoneTest.testGenerateBinaryProfiles had been commented out even before my changes - I removed the code that seemed to relied on system default charset, but did not fix the test
- tidy.jat that is used in UI testing was quite old and IBM JDK had problems executing code (spurious IllegalAccessException in ParserImpl.class): I recompiled the jar using current JVM making sure that source and target are set to 1.4
- in case we ever want to compile it again I attached minor patch to jtidy build 

END
