Second real step to video support in sipXmediaLib. This update is still related to audio code, but it open doors for upcoming video support.
Update include following noticeable changes:

1) New media buffers code. Now it have nice class tree and handy C++ style reference counting.
2) Documentation doxyfication. Almost all .h files have Doxygen style documentation now.
3) Some media resources now process empty inputs slightly different. I used "no input - no output" rule instead of "No input - silent output".
4) Some memory leaks in message processing and MediaTask implementation fixed.
5) New unittests. Released base class for media resource testing - it start/stop media task and setup simple framework for general resource testing. Also several unittests for several media resources was written.

PS New buffers API considered BETA. It is a subject to change.


     * This update needs more testing. Don't update if you rely on its stable work! *
