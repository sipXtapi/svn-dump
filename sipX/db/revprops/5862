[XRR-82] [XRR-85] header files and init restructuring for Registry HA
- Header files for new registry objects, in some cases with stub
  implementations.
- Refactored initialization of the top level objects.
  The OsConfigDb object created by main is now made available to all
  major objects in the constructors, and each object reads what it
  needs from the configuration.  This greatly simplifies the main
  module and SipRegistrar top level object, since they don't have to
  read configuration for other objects.
- Added configuration item for XMLRPC port
- Minor documentation improvements to ResultSet and XmlRpcRequest
- Log clarification in SipUserAgent for messages in queue after
  garbage collection.
