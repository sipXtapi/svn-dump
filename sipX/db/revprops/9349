  XCF-1608 - Workaround hibernate known limitation regarding null in maps. Allow settings values set to NULL and rewrite them to be blank in collection, then return NULL back when getting setting value.  This ineffect means we cannot distinguish blank strings from NULL but this is acceptable

  Partially revert changes introduced in revision 9125. Looks like sipXconfig cannot compute AudioCodes gateway MAC address from the gateway's serial number. sipXconfig will require user to enter device MAC address directly.

  XCF-1624 - Upgrade polycom 2.0 support to 2.1 (still need to change labels to 1.X and 2.X) by taking a whole new approach to polycom profiles. according to a whitepaper published by polycom, we should be installing pristine copies of the profile templates shipped with polycom firmware and only be generate configuration settings that sipxconfig supports.  Therefore we can remove boilerplate content from our velocity files.  This also means that uploading new firmware will provide a new set of pristine templates automatically

  XPB-756: Starting sipXpbx changes file ownership and permission of /user/bin/sipXvxml
  
  Apply Misha's patch
  
  sipxpbx checks if sipXvxml has the right ownership and permission
  if it does not, change it so that it has the right ownership and permission.
  Otherwise, leave it alone.
  
  (The previous version changes sipXvxml without doing the check first.)

  Revamp MpStreamPlaylistPlayer to support unlimited number of prompt entries.
  
  Previous version used a fixed sized array, with a MAX of 40 prompts.
  This isn't big enough for some of the existing VoiceXML scripts
  (dial by name, for example).  Rather than just making it bigger, I
  reworked the code to use a UtlSList instead of an array. 
  
  Fixes XPB-245 (When dialbyname finds too many matches, sometimes, the transfer
  using dialbyname doesn't complete.)

  Fixed XPB-867 Media Server crashes when receives an INVITE with multipart/mixed content type SDP
  
  Merged contribution from Huijun Yang.  He writes:
  
  By adding the following line in SipMessageTest::testMultipartBody(), ( please
  see attached patch for details), I was able to reproduce the crash. 
  
  sdpBody->findMediaType("audio", 0); 
  
  Here is the cause: 
  
  - In SipMessage::getSdpBody, it forcely cast the pointer to object of
    MimeBodyPart to SdpBody*. It is wrong, as an object of MimeBodyPart is NOT
  an object of SdpBody. It caused an invalid memory access and resulted in the
  crash. 
  
  - Also, MimeBodyPart is a subclass of HttpBody. Because HttpBody has
    user-defined constructor, according C++ rule, MimeBodyPart MUST invoke
  HttpBody constructor during base initialization. 
  
  Verified the fix, and the modified test case SipMessageTest::testMultipartBody
  passed without crash.
