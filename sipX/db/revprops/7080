Clean up failed error transfer processing in Auto Attendant
After three attempts with either no DTMF input, or an invalid extension 
is entered, the AA has the ability to transfer to a provisoned extension.  
If THAT provisioned extension is invalid, the call flow now correctly 
informs the caller than an error occurred and hangs up.
Fixes http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XVX-171 (In AA, When Invalid 
responce[sic] is set, does not work properly)
--Woof!
commented out the testActivateDefaultAttendant test
it depended on autoattendant.vm, stopped working after woofs changes
need to rewrite the test - use internally provided .vm file or fix stylesheet used to compare the results to make it less volatile

Enable the VXML engine to wait for prompts to complete.
This corrects many issues with prompts being "cut off" or not played at all
in certain situations.
In sipXmediaLib:
Corrected the ability to "reset" the MpStreamPlaylistPlayer so it
can be waited on when used more than once.  The previous implemenation could
only be waited on once reliably, and it could have failed on subsequent plays.
In sipXvxml:
The OpenVXI VXML engine was missing the required "wait" functionality
that allows it to wait for in process prompts to completely play before
it does something else (like start a transfer).
Added the support for the "wait" function in osbprompt.cpp, and the support
for a null "wait" when no prompts are playing at all.
Added/enabled waiting in PromptManager.cpp and VXI.cpp.

XCF-1132 remove default value (100) of the onfail/transfer-extension parameter - we do not know which extensions are valid 
fix autoattendant.vm template to work properly if transfer-extension is not set - use quiet reference notation - see http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/docs/user-guide.html#Quiet%20Reference%20Notation
