XCF-564 Allow the following special characters in user id and in user aliases: -_.!~*'()&=+$,;?/
This is based on unreserved and user-unreserved character sets from http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt
Use XML entities to define validation patterns so that we do not have to change it in multiple places.
Remove validSipName validator, since it was the same as validSipUserId.
