[XPB-530] Workaround.
  Change the default for the address in the Record-Route header
  inserted by the authproxy to explicitly use the ip address and port.
  This is only a change of how the value is constructed, not an actual
  change in the value.  In earlier revisions, the config.defs variable
  AUTH_PROXY_SERVER_SIP_SRV_OR_HOSTPORT was used, but its value was
  set to ${MY_IP_ADDR}:${AUTH_PROXY_SERVER_SIP_PORT}.  With the HA
  changes, an actual SRV name is used in config.defs.  Due to XPB-530,
  the forking proxy does not correctly route messages that use an SRV
  name in the Route header, so this checkin changes the authproxy to
  always use what it did before.
