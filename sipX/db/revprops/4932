Trivial change to carry this checkin message:
The sip*.sh.in files were accidentally checked in with the previous checkin.
Fix the sip*.sh.in scripts to check that the log files for their components
are either absent or writable, so the components can log any problems they
find.  Otherwise the components have no way of reporting problems.

END
