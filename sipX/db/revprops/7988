XCF-1217 Changed UI for dial plan page. Activate and Reset are now links to separate pages (they used to be buttons on the same page.)
New Reset pages allows resetting dial plan to one of the installed templates. Until now sipXconfig only supported a single template.
New property introduced dialPlanContextImpl.defaultDialPlanId - it keeps the name of the Spring bean with the default template definition. It is only used when new database is initialized and sipXconfig creates default dial plan.
Minor changes in existing definition of dial plan templates: since sipXconfig has to load all the templates and not just default one all the rules names have to be unique: added country prefix to rules names.
