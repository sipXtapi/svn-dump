Merged revisions 8326 via svnmerge from sipXtackLib main branch

Original log message sounds like following:

  Fixed some sipXtackLib unit tests, masked off others for linux.
    There is some difference between linux and windows that is
    manifesting in the order of destructors and some other threading
    problems.  Created XSL-150, XSL-151, and XSL-152 to track them.
........

Really, almost all changes consist of changing dynamically allocated variables to stack variables in unittests.
With my fixes all sipXtackLib unittests run fine under Windows. Linux is not tested yet.
