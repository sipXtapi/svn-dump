XCF-1267 Michal's fixes to Hitachi profile
- use Veloctiy macros instead of copy and paste when generating profiles
- we do not really support well group without any members (I will open a separate issue on that) so when you declare a group in which all members are conditional, declare condition on a group level not on a setting level

END
