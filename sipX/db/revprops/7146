A number of bug fixes and minor enhancements to sipXtapi/call
processing: 

1) Added an accessor to get the contactId used when creating a line
   definition.
2) Added the ability to get the conference handle for a call handle.
3) Added the ability to find a line given a URL.  Also loosened the
   logic for finding a line.  We now check for exact matches (user,
   host, port), followed by user,host) and then just user.
4) Added some simple URL parsing/replacement utilities (VERY simple)
5) Fixed the tone listener implementation -- It works better then
   before, however, some bugs still exist:
   - ToneIds are still in the 0-16 range -- they do not match the
   SIPX_TONE_ID (translation is needed in both directions -- receiving
   and sending).
   - In some cases ToneIds are not received -- I believe we aren't
   getting/decoding them in mp.  More investigation needed here.
6) When acting as the transferee, use the contactId of the
   SipConnection receiving the REFER method request.  Meaning, if that
   connection was using a local address (not STUN or relay), then
   continue to use that local address.
7) If we create a new call (as a reaction to a transfer), make sure
   that new call is associated with the conference in sipXtapi.
