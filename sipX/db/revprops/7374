XCF-1187 back-end for generating caller-alias data set
- support for per-gateway default and per-user external number
- generics in CoreContext and GatewayContext
- updated SipUrl facility - needed to generate more identity and alias URIs
- change in extension dataset - it now uses new USer.getNumericAliases method and it only adds first numeric alias (we used to add all numeric aliases to extension dataset but they were ignored by IMDB anyway)

END
