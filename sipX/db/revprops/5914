Remove these comments about the registration DB from Redirection.txt because this is no longer true:

    You can read the in-memory database directly using the
    sipdbtest utility found in the sipXcommserverLib.
    file.

We took this feature out of sipdbtest because it was an obstacle to implementing HA (high availability).
