slight change of behavior when working with Show/Hide Advanced settings
before: when setting value is modified and then hidden, the change is ignored when user presses OK/Apply
now: the change is save on OK/Apply and only ignored on Cancel

Highlight settings that are modified, helps usability to determine overridden values.
