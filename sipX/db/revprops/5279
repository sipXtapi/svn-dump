FIX: due to subtle Tapestry problem pageSize setting was ignored on phones and users page - they defaulted to 10 lines per page which is not enough in most cases
Also: moved pageSize setting to Visit object and make Visit object to be injected from Spring - this allows admins to tweak pageSize by setting
visit.tablePageSize property in sipxconfig.properties.in file
