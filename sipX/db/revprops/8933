Added more test cases to MpAudioBufTest

Fixed problem with MpAudioBuf::compareSamples identified in unit test
where it falsely said two buffers were the same.

Fixed a bunch of problems in the MpInputDeviceManager and unit test:
    was deleting key twice instead of key and value in hashMap
    unit test used buffer pool with chunks too small causing overwrite

Note: MpInputDeviceManager  unit test still is hanging 1 in 10 times on
windows most likely due to some race or unsafe shutdown of the device driver
or the manager.

Fixed problems with sipXmediaLib/src/mp/MprSineWaveGeneratorDeviceDriver.cpp
    was shutting down its reader task twice

removed duplicate implementation inline and in cpp file for MpInputDeviceDriver.
