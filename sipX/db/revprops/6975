A variety of modifications to improve the building process

Manage sipx version of w3c-libwww depending on distro

Use distro name RHE instead RHEL

Define platforms in order to set LIBWWW_RPM

We build and 'rpm -u sipx-w3c-libwww'

Initiate a LIBWWW_RPM setup process

Don't uninstall existing ruby RPMs since we don't build them for FC4/5

END
