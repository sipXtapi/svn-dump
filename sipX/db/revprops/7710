XCF-1099 Fixed Hibernate exception when saving user who is supervising its own group.
Changed cascade parameter on user->supervised groups associations from "save-update" to "none" - the drawback is that you have to pass saved groups to User.addSupervisorForGroup method, but it this function only worked reliable if saved groups were passed.
Added "saveNew" parameter to SettingDao.getGroupsByString to allow for one step adding and saving of groups. 

END
