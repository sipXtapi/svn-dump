Update new audio output system: now MprToOutputDevice send NULL frame to device if it have nothing to play. This is very useful in direct write mode, because output driver do not need to know - was frame pushed at last frame processing cycle or not. This also gracefully fix problems with audio quality in direct write mode in Windows driver.
