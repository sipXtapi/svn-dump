Forking proxy restructuring
   [XPR-182] If authproxy is configured, ensure it is always used.
   This allows Route header parameters in redirects without creating a
   security problem, which is needed to support mappings that route to
   a domain through a specified intermediary (such as an SBC).

Add unit tests for more of the forking proxy.

Add normalizeProxyRoutes to SipMessage to perform inbound route header
normalization for proxies.  This is used now in the forking proxy, and
is ready for use in the authproxy, but merging it in is too big a job
right now.

Add Url::fromString method to allow setting an existing Url object
from a string value.

Add documentation for forwardingrules.xml

Clean up several compiler warnings from gcc 4.0
