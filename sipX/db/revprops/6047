Addtional merges from main:
    Initialized merge tracking via svnmerge with revisions 1-6033 from
    https://scm.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipX/branches/sipXconfig/3.3

    Roll kingkonf into sipXcommserverLib

    XPB-500 new attendant schedule file name and format - is: /schedules/autoattendant (used to be: /organizationprefs/schedule)
    also file name suffix is now -schedule.xml (used to be _schedule.xml)

    sipxconfig startup error byproduct of freezing db schema

    Do not check sipx db revision in configtest, no guarontee db has been upgraded yet.  Add check to make sure db is running though

    Fixed the date format to be in sync with config server.

    Add 'create-label' command group to make links from the sipX*/meta directories
    to the top directory.
