Replication fixes:
==================

Fix user permissions not replicating because of save v.s. update events from hibernate.  take different approach by writing aspect to watch for .save* or .delete* on Daos
Replication context factored out from Process context.
Replication context is always asynchronous, ProcessContext needs to be synchronous.
lazy replication strategy - multiple replication request result in a single operation if exceuted within time window;
default replication delay is set to 7 seconds; can be reconfigured through spring file 

Even mechanism refactoring:
========================== 
- detecting events separated from publishing events - this is necessary since we have to support both AOP and manually generated events
- all event related code moved into new package: org.sipfoundry.sipxconfig.common.event
- fixed deleteUsers to manually send DAO notifications - it is not practical to intercept this method using AOP 

Job Status:
===========

support for reporting on background job status
Initial Job Status page implementation.
Phone profile projection and restart is now using JobContext to record status of the operation.
LazyDaemon factored out of replication context. To be used for house keeping in jobs contexts.


XCF-81 Domain name change

Misc:
=====

Added template for EasyMock generation.
Go to Eclipse->Preferences->Editor->Templates and import meta/eclipse.java.editor-templates.xml
Go one of your test (or any Java file) - type mc and prese Ctrl+Space

TestPage.login is now using a first user to login rather than specific TEST_USER.
It's important for all the test that see database by clicking on "seed test user" link.
