Two sipXvxml changes:

1) In DTD.hpp, the DTD for vxml documents is defined in a char array,
however, the array length did not match the actual amount of bytes
(it was larger).  The resulted in a somewhat odd parsing error on the
last character of the DTD.

2) Disabled validation (actually set it to auto).  This needs to be turned back on at some point -- see Jira XVX-10.  This is a work around to get the sipXvxml running and testable.
