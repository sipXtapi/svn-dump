All of the changes needed to build the sipXtack project with the new
set of utility libraries.  I did make a few hack to get this to compile:

1) In SipLine::copyCredentials(...), I casted form a const reference to a
   non-cast reference.  Needs to be looked at. (Jira: XSL-2)


2) I commented out the ->insert(...) in SipMessage::parseViaParameters.
   The parameter is passed in as a UtlContainer, however, that class
   does not define an insert method.  Scott will reworking the class
   hierarchy to accommodate this. (Jira: XSL-3)
