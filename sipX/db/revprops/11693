Restructured Android audio drivers to account for signature differences in Android 2.0-2.3 vs. 2.3
  Split use of Android AudioTrack and AudioRecord into separate libs so that they can be compiled
  against 2.0 and 2.3 to produce two speparate libs which can be dyamically loaded for the current
  platform.
  AudioTrack constructor and AudioRecord::set have different signatures in Andoird 2.3 vs. 2.0-2.2
