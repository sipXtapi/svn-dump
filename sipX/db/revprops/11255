sipXsdpLib: Add a workaround for RFC4733 tones to SDP handling.
We use empty fmtp string by default, but some implementations (e.g. X-Lite) prefer to explicitely specify "0-15" (default value). To interoperate with them we should equal "0-15" to empty fmtp.
Now this is done more like a quick hack, and later will probably be changed to provide wider support for all this crazy fmtp handling stuff. AMR and Speex are ones who appeals to this a lot.
