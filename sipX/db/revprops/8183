Fix for ARM Static initializer access violation in SipXmediaLibTest and sipXmediaAdapterLibTest.

The problem turned out to be located at
instantiation of UtlString from MpCodecInfo constructor - MpdSipxPcmu::smCodecInfo

Has to do with implicit construction of a UtlString from a const char*, UtlString copy constructor called to initialize MpCodecInfo's UtlString member, then destruction of the implicit UtlString -- access violation happens in the destructor of UtlString, trying to deallocate what seems to be const char* data.

Fixed by changing the MpCodecInfo constructor to take a const char* instead of a UtlString.  Any uses of it that pass in a UtlString should still work -- they'll call UtlString's const char* cast function.
END
