Per P. van Bruggen (build error on VC7 w/ "interface"
keywork):

> The problem is that the new VC7 doesn't support the interface
> keyword anymore. It only supports __interface keyword.
> 
> As MSDN states:
> Microsoft Specific
> In Microsoft C++, identifiers with two leading underscores
> are reserved for compiler implementations. Therefore, the
> Microsoft convention is to precede Microsoft-specific
> keywords with double underscores. These words cannot be
> used as identifier names
> 
> Therefore the used interface keyword must be changed to
> __interface. As far as i know this will also compile
> under VC6.
> 
> The best place to do this (and the most logical) is in
> the same area as where the #define interface struct has
> been done for Unix like / VXWORKS targets.
> 
> If the __inteface does not work on VC6 then the define
> must be placed in the following block:
> 
> #ifdef _MSC_VER
>     #if _MSC_VER >= 1300
>         #define interface __interface
>     #endif
> #else
>     #define interface struct
> #endif
