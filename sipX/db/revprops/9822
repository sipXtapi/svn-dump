Some fixes to the windows output device driver... 
Latency reduced to 30ms within driver, but any lower, and clicking occurs.
Fixed bug when MpOutputDeviceManager is in direct write mode, causing total starvation - ticker fell out of loop and stopped ticking (driven directly by incoming packets).  Solved with injection of silence when at critical low buffer level.
Added more description in comments, updated some variable names to make them more clear.

Occasionally, callback is called twice successively, without any delay at all, which seems to be a telltale sign something is amiss.
END
