Move the insert() method back to UtlContainer.
Needed for http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-3

The ambiguities this created in UtlHashMap are partially resolved
by substituting an internal value whenever a value=NULL is stored
in the hash map.  There are still UtlHashMap interfaces in which the
return value can be ambiguous if you ever store NULL values.
Caveat caller.
