-fix in MprToneGen for calling stop on a one-shot tone for TopologyFlowGraph
  - required additional virtual getType member on MpFlowGraphBase in order
    to determine the flow graph type without using RTTI
-fix in MpToneResourceMsg to use int to store toneid - since special tones (ie. dialtone) 
 use id's larger than u_int8
END
