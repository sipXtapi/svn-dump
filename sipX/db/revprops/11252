sipXmediaLib: Fix decoding of RFC4733 tones.
1) Our Jitter Buffer Estimator can't handle RFC4733 events correctly, because they always have timestamp of the *beginning* of the event, not the start of the current packet. Some day we should teach JBE to handle this correctly.
2) Also do not update current stream position after RFC4733 packet docode because of the same reason.
