XCF-888 Looks like getting a database snapshot was subtly interacting with Hibernate check for dirty properties: as a result if you only modified user aliases the object was never saved (or was saved without calling interceptor that indexes the object).
I modified the GetOriginalValueCallback to call getDatabaseSnapshot directly on persister (calling this on persisterContext was creating a cache entry that was fooling hibernate).
Quite frankly I am not sure if we are using API incorrectly or may be stepping on a hibernate bug here but modified code seems to work OK. I also added a UserTestDb.testUpdateAliases to make sure we are doing this correctly.
