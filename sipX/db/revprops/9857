Add another statistic - absDelta - a running delta since the beginning of the series calculated from current value to beginning.  Effectively shows hiccups (double-hits) that occur on some systems (mine) when using Linear mode timer on windows.

Significantly widen the acceptable threshold for single values, as the mean is more interesting and useful.

checkMeanAgainstThresholds took start and end values that were in types not big enough to hold them - updated to use int64_t.
