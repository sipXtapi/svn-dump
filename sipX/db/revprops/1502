State machine skeleton essentially in place.

This is a state machine for the UI of the sipXezPhone, 
 loosely based on the State design pattern by Gamma, et al.

External events (generated by the sipXtapi layer, and 
by user interaction) can occur in any order, and can occur while
 the phone is in any state.  So, the state machine
 manages the transitioning of phone states in 
 response to external events.

Needs to be fleshed out more.  Most transitions are
 not yet implemented.
