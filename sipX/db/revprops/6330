Possible fix for semget problem in RegistryDBTest. Contrary to
comments in the code the database was never closed when calling
removeDatabase(). 

Added an extra function SIPDBManager::closeDatabase. Added a boolean
parameter to RegistrationDB::releaseInstance to close database,
defaulting to false for backward compatibility.

Set that parameter to true in cleanup code of RegistryDBTest. The
database will now be closed after every test, hopefully elimination
the semget errors.

END
