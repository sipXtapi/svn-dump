Fix compiler warnings in sipXmediaLib.

A few looked like real bugs, waiting to bite us:
1) class has virtual methods, but destructor is not virtual
2) too few arguments for format in printf analogue

The vast majority were harmless, and fell under
1) unreference variables
2) comparison between signed and unsigned
3) order variations between class headers and constructor initializers
4) type mismatch between format and argument to printf analogue
5) quoted string passed to char* typed argument
6) debugging output macros that were disabled by expanding to "(0)"

There were a bunch of complaints about the same four unused static
functions that operated on "CRITICAL_SECTIONS".  These were actually
instantiated in a header file, so every file that included something
that included that header file got a copy of these functions.  I
cleaned that up, in rtcp/BaseClass{.h,.cpp}
