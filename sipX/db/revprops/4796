Modified sipXphone/pinger to work with call processing changes:

> Added audio functions (volume, setting audio devices, etc) to the
> media interface factory.  This is needed to enable plug-and-play
> media processing subsystems.  Started to also remove references
> to DmaTask:: and MpCodec in sipXtapi and Pinger.  
>
> More to do
