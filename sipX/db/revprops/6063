[XPB-444] Do not treat an unrecognized revision as an error in
          upgrade.

   This comes up every time we create a new release, so I'm
   changing the default.  If there is something that needs to be
   upgraded, then this needs to be modified to deal with it, but if
   there is no upgrade manipulation to do then we should not have to
   edit this script just to recognize another number.
