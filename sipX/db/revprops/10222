speex plugin vs2005 project changes to put it more in line with speex lib
project settings:

* Compile all as C code, not C++ (release + debug targets)
* Ignore MSVCRTD default library as speex statically links the CRT in (release + debug targets)
* Subsystem changed from Windows to 'Not Set' - we're not making a windows application here, just a DLL. (release + debug targets)
* Turn on more optimization (matching speex) -- full optimization, inline all inlinable functions, enable intrinsic functions, enable string pooling. (release target)
* Turn off exception handling (release + debug targets)
* Turn off debug information generation (release target)
* Turn off optimization for windows 98 (release + debug targets)
* Copy over libspeex dll itself to the sipXmediaLib/bin directory (release target) (already present in debug target)
* Innocuous rearrangement of included C files in project.
