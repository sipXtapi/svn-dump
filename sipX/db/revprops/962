First pass coding of the core utilities for the new
SUBSCIBE server and client.  The client is implemented,
but not tested.  Unit tests exist for some of the core
utilities.  This stuff is being checked in so that it
can be reviewed and so that dependent applications
currently being developed can proceed.
