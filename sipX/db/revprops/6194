XCF-753 fix for EditCallGroup unit tests
we no longer can use SiteTestHelper.submitLink (which is probably a good think since it was a hack)
Tapestry 4 javascript is much cleaner and we can use httpunit/rhino support to execute javascript on client side during unit tests: I checked in js.jar (rhino)
When writing unit tests one can treat submit links as any other links. To click it use "clickLink" method and pass link id (not link name!).

END
