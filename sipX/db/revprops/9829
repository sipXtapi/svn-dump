Boston Bridge was using a generic api to get the local adapter address to place in the SDP body.  
When there are multiple NICs this api can return an incorrect IP (from wrong NIC).  
Previously modified to use the sentHost parameter form the top most via of the SIP Invite, 
but this does not work when calling UA is on the same box as bbridge.

New fix:
  - New setting in .conf file BOSTON_BRIDGE_MEDIA_IP_ADDRESS - if blank (or not present) then behavior is as was before - OS is queried for IP address

END
