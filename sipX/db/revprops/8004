mergefrom pingtel-main 7525

Copy improved definition of OsTimer::compareTimes from Pingtel Main.
Improved debugging messages on timer system:
Put in some additional checks that the objects on which the OsTimer
methods are call are really OsTimers.
Only report on a slow timer firing routine if it takes more than 1
sec.  (Because nearly 100 msec is seen routinely even in lightly
loaded systems.)
Only report on messages processed by SipUserAgent::handleMessage if
its queue exceeds 100 messages.

END
