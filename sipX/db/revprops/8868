Numerous style fixes in MpInputDeviceManager.

* Space after 'if'.
* Member variables should be initialized in initialization section, not in constructor body.
* If constructor parameter is stored in member variable, then use member variable in constructor body to prevent errors.
* Inline definitions should visually distinguish from definitions, so place its body on new line. This also prevents 80 column overrun in many cases.
