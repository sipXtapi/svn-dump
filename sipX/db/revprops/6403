XCF-949 Use copytruncate on sipxconfig.log only

XCF-955 Use log4j instead of jetty's logger, this is not the fix, but just a stepping stone

XCF-955 Send USR2 messages from logrotate script

[XPB-413] Clean up mediaserver_cgi zombies
          This change actually disables persistent connection support
          on the web server interface provided by the status server.
          This server is called from the mediaserver_cgi (can anyone
          suggest a way to make this _more_ complicated?).  There is
          no performance benefit, and it seems that the connections
          are not getting cleaned up properly.  Ultimately the httpd
          runs out of child processes, and prompts don't play.
    http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-413

- added EnumFormat - supports localized display of "commons" Enum objects 
- added MillisDurationFormat - supports human readable display of duration expressed in millis (i.e. something like 10 hours, 5 minutes)
- added AutoRefreshForm component - special form that automatically refreshes its content - you can specify interval or refresh it on demand

XCF-928 - Convert date strings in unit test to local date format before comparing

XCF-929 - Convert default date to local date string format before using

Rollback changes, go with simple copytruncate. Quantom of time a log entry could be missed is not worth system instability:
Did
  svn merge -r6378:6375 .

fix Tacos integration: one can actually use AJAX component

remove unused properties

Temporatily take the Subscribe client, server and refresh manager
tests out of the unit test suite as they are crashing with no
ccpunit output on some platforms.
