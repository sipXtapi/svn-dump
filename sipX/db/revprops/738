Assorted code cleanups, make doxygen docs by default.
Restructured queueMessageToInterestedObservers to be more
  efficient and much easier to understand.
  (This is why I was editing this in the first place -
   I was originally going to add support for observing
   sent packets, and trying to get proxied responses, but
   those changes didn't work out.  But in trying to understand
   how all this worked I ended up cleaning it up a bit.)
Made branch ids a little easier to read by inserting '-' after 3261
  cookie (and cleaned up construction a bit)
Removed quite a bit of confusing commented-out code
Removed tab characters.
