Add the getProcessStatus SOAP method to the WSDL, SOAP server, and SOAP unit test.
Change the WSDL to use document style/literal use rather than document style/encoding use.  Document/encoded is not WSI-compliant and was not intended -- when I switched from RPC-style to document-style I should have changed the "use" as well.
