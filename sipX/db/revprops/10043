Parent resources in recursive resource chains need to override MpResource::setFlowGraph() and pass on the flowgraph pointer to their resource children in order to function properly.
MpResource::setFlowGraph moved from private to protected, and is now a virtual function in these changes.
Specific recursive resource chain (the only one that I am aware of) that was changed is MpRtpInputAudioConnection with child MprDecode.
