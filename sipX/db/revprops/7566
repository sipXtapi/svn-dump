[XPB-761] Correct problems with incorrect voicemail message counts
  The problem appears to have been a result of the fact that the
  summary.xml file in each folder cached the counts, but could under
  some circumstances end up with the wrong counts.  Some mechansims
  use the cached values, and others used the actual message files.
  This change eliminates the summary.xml file mechansim, and just
  counts the files in the (few) cases in which we need the numbers.
[XCF-1251] correct status report following purge of deleted messages
[XPB-777] fix delete all in mailbox
