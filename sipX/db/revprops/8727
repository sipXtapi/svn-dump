Automated build makefile for gnu autoconf targets.

from readme in linux build section:
Makefile.gnu
There is also a makefile in the root of sipXtapi used by an automated build
system that does all steps necessary to build libraries and tests from a
freshly checked out sandbox from the subversion repository.  While not built
with normal users in mind, it can be used by them.  Find more information in
the makefile itself.
