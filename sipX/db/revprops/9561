Removed synchronization delay hack from sipxtapi initialize which was effective in Windows. It delayed startup by unacceptable 500ms. Now startup takes acceptable ~180ms. Stresstests calling init/uninit very fast didn't reveal any problems.

The reason why the delay hack was there, was to wait in Windows until OsServerTask is started. I believe OsServerTasks should be written to be immune to frequent start/stop without having to wait.
