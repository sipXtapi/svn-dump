Hitachi IP5000  configuration files provided by Martin
- added generating TFTP profile
- several basic settings modeled (line info, proxy, registrar, realm etc.)
Still need to:
- model remaining settings
- add Velocity expressions to user.ini.vm
- write tests (plugins tests that require application context only work from Eclipse now - classpath problems)

END
