XCF-998 tie enabling CSE logging in authproxy and forking proxy to a single CALLRESOLVER_CALL_STATE_DB variable defined in config.defs
this simplifies CDR configuration in sipXconfig
By default CSE generation is now enabled since CDR generation does not require much resources on typical systems any more - it's state might be changed to DISABLED if 3.7 testing proves otherwise.
