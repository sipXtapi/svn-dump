One more fix for ICE support.
We send a=candidate instead of a=cand as http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-17 mentions only a=candidate.
As transport we send always UDP, as http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-17#section-15.1 only defines UDP. Although a "token" defined in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#page-220 can also be sent, the other side might not understand it.

ICE support needs to be fully updated to the latest draft 17.
END
