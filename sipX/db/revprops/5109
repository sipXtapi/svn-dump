Set DISTCLEANFILES so 'make distclean' removes built files.
Set up CONFIG_DISTCLEANFILES so components which include 'config' as
an external can know what to put in DISTCLEANFILES.

Fix use of compareTo so non-default port designations are recognized
as such.  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPL-125

Remove conflict marker inadvertently left in file.

Document the invocation of autoreconf.

Fix the build problem:
config.status: error: cannot find input file: sipXconference/Makefile.in

Fix the build problem:
awk: fatal: can't open source file `./config/apache_version.awk' 
	for reading (No such file or directory)

Add entries for sipXconverence, but do not activate them.

Revamp handling of headers specified in URIs.
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-107
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XSL-108

Statics are not your friend -- fix for
SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps.  In SipMessage, replaced the
static SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps initializer with a pointer
and initialize it in the constructor of SipMessage.  Also, renamed
the variable to spSipMessageFieldProps instead of
mSipMessageFieldProps.  SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps touches
the UtlChainPool (also a static) and blows up under Windows.
Essentially, one cannot guarantee the order of static
initialization.  In this case, SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps
was initialized before UtlChainPool resulting in a crash during
static initialization.

Put parentheses around expression in #define.

Improve copyright notices.

Fix use of compareTo so non-default port designations are recognized as such.
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPL-125

Fix the sip*.sh.in scripts to check that the log files for their components
are either absent or writable, so the components can log any problems they
find.  Otherwise the components have no way of reporting problems.

Add sipXmediaAdapterLib as a component.

Start adjusting the command groups for the fact that all the code is in
one repository.

Link in a media subsystem.

Move mediaAdaptorLib before callLib in the build order, as the
dependencies have been rearranged.

Remove special OpenSSL from code base.
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-80

Clean problems related to isReadyToRead().
Remove call of isReadyToRead() from a debugging print, as that function blocks.

Report "residual" bytes after a SIP message as an error in UDP, but as debug
info in TCP and TLS.

Add some debugging prints.

Replace definition of "WD" in Makefile.

Put all files that depend on the install directory into DISTCLEANFILES.

Add an orbits.xml file to the test configuration.

Remove erroneous element in ProcessDefinitions.xml.

Use 'make' iterations to repeat command groups for different components.

Add script for checking the svnmerge properties of the principal branches.

Fix typo in .spec file:  RPM is sipxcommserverlib-devel, not sipxcommserver-devel.

Add commentary based on an inquiry by Jerry Richards.

Add a file describing call flows for the call pick-up features.

Test fix for SipUserAgent/OsTimer/OsSysSoftTimer lockup:  Increase the message
queue sizes from 1,000 to 10,000.

Add more logging of transaction garbage collection.

Parse URIs correctly -- field parameters have their own unique quoting
system.

Add function SipMessage::isInSupportedField to allow easy testing for tokens
in the Supported header.

Fix the properties on some files.
