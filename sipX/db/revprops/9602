Cleanup for fix from rev9600.
1) No need to get buffer if data to play is not set, and so no need to release it then.
2) No need to put silence to buffer right after first check for available data. It would be done in the next 'if' - if in loop, then rest of the buffer will be filled with new data, else filled with silence.

END
