Change the text for response code 420 from "Bad Extension" to
"Extension Not Supported".  The new text is a better explanation of
the problem (since the extension may be quite correct, the problem is
that the SIP agent does not support it).  This avoids confusing a
person (like me) who is trying to diagnose a SIP problem.
