XCF-786 Sorting phones by model fixed. It required implementing sorting by multiple fields both in database and in Lucene index since model is really a concatenation of beanId and modelId (roughly corresponding to manufacturer and model).
We cannot really sort phones by lines effectively. I disabled that.
