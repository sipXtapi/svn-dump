Merge out from main:
    Improve usage message.
    RpmPackage debug/debuginfo fix
    Print status information about what build labels were used and what
    configuration switches that created.
    Remove extraneous 'cd' output
    Tighten up how the returned status from a subprocess is handled, so
    that if the subprocess returns null or garbage, the test won't produce
    a "unary operator expected" message, nor an invalid result.
    Improve some comments on the structure of the label file.
    Add --verbose to suppress -s from "make" invocations.
    Add --configure to allow ./configure options to be specified on the
    command line.
    Allow relative directories as destination argument.
    Some more adjustments to ./build so that it displays variables from
    multiple labels correctly.

    Prevent ./build from hanging when no labels are specified.
    Allow "-p Project+" to mean "Project" and all following projects in
    the standard build order.
    At the beginning of a run, print the order projects will be built.
    Get the tab characters out of ./build.
    In some places, I had to use the $'...\t...' construction, which may
    not be as portable as we'd like, but it appears to be Posix standard
    on the bash manual page.
    Modified to comply with the new dist tree

    Remove tabs from ./build.
