Explicity copy payload IDs from remote side only when we receive SDP offer.
  We cannot change the payload IDs that we expect to recieve after we make an offer.
  (i.e. don't try to match payload IDs for receive from SDP answer after we offer)
  Always be prepared to receive our full set of enabled codecs.
