Address a bunch of PBX build/configuration issues:

  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-47
    SSL certs and keys are now $prefix/etc/sipxpbx/ssl/ssl.{key,crt}

  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-41
    Apache logs are now in $prefix/var/log/sipxpbx

  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-20
    All Apache configuration is now in $prefix/etc/sipxpbx

Search rules for many of configure --with-<something> arguments 
have been changed so that if the switch is given, then configure
does not look elsewhere (you get what you asked for, or nothing).
Failure messages for these now list where the search looked.

Apache components now all search in the same order, decreasing the 
chance of getting components from different installations.

  

END
