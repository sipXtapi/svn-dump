Fix Linux breakage I introduced in r11025.
While VC6 compiler was now happy - satisfied that the maximum() call was now
unambiguous, Gnu GCC compiler now was confused and found ambiguity.

This now should remove all ambiguity and make everyone happy.
I think the problem lied in the negation -- the negation may have been taking
an int16_t and making it something else.
