Noise Reduction: Removed printf debugging strings in OS Layer:

OsBSemWnt::rlse(): GetLastError = 6!
  (The handle is invalid.)

OsUtilWnt::synchObjAcquire: WaitForSingleObject() returned -1,
   GetLastError() = 6

These errors are caused by someone trying to acquire/release with a 
bad handle.  A non-success error code is bubbled back up in these
cases.
