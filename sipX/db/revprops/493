 In UtlContainer.h, the acquireIteratorConnectionLock method should be protected.

If this method is left at the protected access level, then
Microsoft Visual C++ is correctly failing to compile all UtlIterator derived classes.

Here's whats going on: UtlIterator declares UtlContainer to be a friend.

However, as in real-life, your parent's friends are not neccessarily your friends.
So, the UtlIterator derived classes cannot access the protected acquireIteratorConnectionLock.

So, I suppose each derived class needs to declare UtlContainer as its friend.

As a quick fix, this method has been upgraded to the public access level.
The real fix is to change all UtlIterator derived classes to declare UtlContainer as their friends.

This also applies to releaseIteratorConnectionLock.
