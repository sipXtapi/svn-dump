XCF-753 - Partial upgrade to Tapestry 4.0
 - Jar files upgraded manually (e.g. not maven)
 - Web compiles and login page, test page and home pages works
 - web test unit  (not ui tests!) tests all pass except 1 OptionalElementTest
 - Tasks have been organized into PortingTodoTest.java
 - Had to reformat *.page and *.jwc files to get search and replace tools
   to work but all are consistent now. Once I'm convinced search/replace is 
   no longer needed, will wrap xml to something other than infinity
