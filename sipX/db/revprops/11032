Fix deadlocks in Windows output driver.
With WMM you're alowed to call only tight set of functions from device callback (see MSDN documentation for waveOutOpen()), while we used to send ticker notification with mpNotifier->signal() from there, which led to call of MpodWinMM::pushFrame() and in turn waveOutWrite(). This sequence causes deadlock deep inside of WMM code in recent Vista versions.
So, to workaround this we've created a separate thread which do nothing but waits for sugnal from WMM callback and sends ticker notification.
