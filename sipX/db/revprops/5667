Next revision of the HA registrar design.
Gives a lot more detail of the various processes.
Start-up processing needs to be worked out in more detail.
Also, need to figure out whether a registrar, when it comes up, needs
to recover its own previous (and presumably lost) database from the
other registrar.  If so, need a more elaborate data push/pull system.
If not, some of the current machinery can be removed, espcially
the base times stored in the DB.
