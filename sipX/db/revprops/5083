Fix XCF-588: When editing a phone line, make phone label a link. Also:
Add DB constraints requiring phone serial # to be unique and non-null.
Replace ok/cancel/apply buttons on the EditPhone page with FormActions, for simplicity and to get callback handling, since EditPhone is now accessed from multiple pages.
