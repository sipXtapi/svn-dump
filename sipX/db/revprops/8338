Generate sipxrls.sh correctly.

Activate preprocessing of sipXrls's Makefile.am's.
Add RlsSubscribe to filter subscription requests for "Supported: eventlist".
Get subscribe client machinery working.

Alphabetize entries in Makefile.am.

Add sipXpbx/sipXrls to EXTRA_DIST so that it will be included in the tarballs,
because sipXpbx/configure.ac mentions the Makefile.am's in sipXpbx/sipXrls.
sipXrls should be moved from EXTRA_DIST to SUBDIRS when the code is ready
for others.
