Make MpArrayBuf, MpDataBuf and MpAudioBuf interfaces consistent in getting pointer to data. Also separate const and non-const versions of getSamples() in MpAudioBuf.
This change lead to many small fixes in sipXmediaLib files. I appologize if this break someone's patches or so. This change have to be applied much earlier.
