XCF-1391 initialize method is now only called once - in getSettings method when it's called for the first time when settings are actually loaded
Minor fix to ClearonePhone support: generating dial plan for the phone was not working: dialplan file name and dial plan template name were passed to generateProfile function in the wrong order
