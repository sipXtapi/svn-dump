Add protection against the caller starting a timer on one thread while
deleting it on another thread.
This version of the code aborts on an assert() violation when this
race condition is detected.  We may want to revise how this is
handled, but in the long run, any application which triggers this
assert() should be fixed.
Sharpen the check in OsTimer::doStartTimer.
Fix minor bugs in PlaceCall and ReceiveCall.
Correct the values returned by SipDialog::getStateString.
Allow siptest to receive NOTIFY requests.
Turn on console output in siptest.  (Otherwise it logs nothing.)
Add latest improvements to siptrace-merge.
Add merge-logs.
Improve comments.
Fix miscellaneous typos.
