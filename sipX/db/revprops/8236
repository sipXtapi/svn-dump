[XPB-850] Always use local MTA to send email notices for voicemail
          Voicemail notifications are blocked during a long timeout (3
          mins) if the destination mailserver isn't accessible.
          This change requires that the mail always be sent to a
          localhost MTA, which can then take care of queuing and
          retries when the real server is not available.
