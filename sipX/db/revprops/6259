Add Registration State Replication for High Availability calling service.

    In large systems, high availability (HA) is essential; a system with
    more than a few dozen users generally must not have any unexpected
    outages for basic calling. In sipXpbx, basic calling depends on three components:
    the two proxies and the registry/redirect service. The proxies can
    be replicated, using DNS SRV records to share load and provide for
    failover. The registry/redirect service, however, can not currently
    be deployed on multiple servers because the 'soft' state in the
    registry database (mappings from registered Addresses to Contacts)
    cannot be shared. While replicating the proxies alone does help with
    scaling, the registry is a single point of failure for basic calling
    service.

    See the design document at
         http://scm.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipX/main/sipXregistry/doc/SyncDesign.html
    and the installation document at
         http://scm.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipX/main/sipXregistry/doc/HaSetup.pdf

    Development was on the branch
         http://scm.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipX/branches/registry_ha
         revisions  5847 through 6248

Other changes along the way from that branch:

    Add queue limit to OsServerTask startup debug log

    Clarify log message for SSL handshake errors

    Remove the ability to load the registration database from sipdbtest.

    Take the hardwired URL path for XML-RPC, "/RPC2", and make it a
    public string constant, XmlRpcDispatch::DEFAULT_URL_PATH

    Add framework for unit tests of commserver components that need to
    read and write files, including subclasses for SipDb tests and
    RegistrationDb tests.

    Take out some bad info on certificate installation.

    Improve documentation of SSL setup using a well-known CA.

    Added boolean parameter to OsFileSystem::createDir to force creation of
    non-existing parent directories.

    Add SmartDbAccessor class for sipdb databases, which ensures that
    the DB is attached at the beginning and detached at the end.

    Adding simple XmlRpc test server and client.

    Improve logging for connection setup, especially listening sockets.
    Don't attempt to initialize SSL on a socket when the connect failed.

    Fix test for locating openssl library path
      It was always adding /usr/local/lib to the path rather than the
      right place.

    Added persistent connections to HttpMessage and HttpServer. On the
    client side a connection is kept in a connection map and existing
    connections can be looked up and reused. On the server side a
    connection is kept open and runs as an OsTask until it is closed
    by the peer.

    Loosen up the schema for uri and contact fields.  The patterns in
    sip_types.xsd don't work for some reason.  Include TODO comments
    to fix that.

    Added sipx-dns script for generating DNS configuration records.

    Added validation of watchdog.xml

    Fixed a bug in xml file validation that caused some errors to be lost.

    Clean up logging of XML-RPC messages.

    Change the newlines in the XML-RPC messages to make them take fewer
    lines and make the structures easier to read.

    Fix XSL-116: XML-RPC must escape special chars in string values.
    This should also fix XRR-100 and XRR-101, since it is the underlying cause.
    Also fix an incorrect XML-RPC fault message.

    Change adding the daemon account to the fedora standard test

    Add validation of the ProcessDefinitions.xml configuration.

    [XPB-523] Test for incorrect names in /etc/hosts for the localhost address
              http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPB-523
