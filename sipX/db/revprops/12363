When creating a new CpPeerCall for incoming call, yeild to be sure call state is fully created.
CallManager created a new call for incoming INVITE, but did not yeild to let
new call task initialize all call transaction state info needed to match 
incoming messages in the same dialog.  If a CANCEL came in before the call task
got time to finish initialization, the CANCEL was not matched to the call and
sent 481.  Now we yeild until the call task initializes call state info.

END
