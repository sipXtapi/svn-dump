Windows output device driver: Minimize deadlock situation which happens when device is being disabled at the same time a frame is being pushed.

A proper fix to entirely eliminate the deadlock should be implemented.
One such possibility is to lock every access to WaveIn* calls so that only one WaveIn call is being made at any given time.
