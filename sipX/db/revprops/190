Change JBOSS_HOME to point to where Jboss in unzipped, NOT including the additional '/jboss' and NOT require TOMCAT_HOME to be defined.  It's more constant with other packages, removes possiblity they point to different locations AND help simplfy install process.  NOTE: If you only read one thing

  export JBOSS_HOME=<somedir>/JBoss-2.4.10_Tomcat-4.0.6
