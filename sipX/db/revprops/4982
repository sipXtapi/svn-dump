Set DISTCLEANFILES so 'make distclean' removes built files.

Fix DISTCLEANFILES to delete autom4te.cache.

Fix use of compareTo so non-default port designations are recognized as such.
http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XPL-125

Update DISTCLEANFILES.

Remove conflict marker.
Document invocation of autoreconf.

Fix the sip*.sh.in scripts to check that the log files for their components
are either absent or writable, so the components can log any problems they
find.  Otherwise the components have no way of reporting problems.

Add sipXmediaAdapterLib as a component.
Start adjusting the command groups for the fact that all the code is in
one repository.

Link in a media subsystem.

Move mediaAdaptorLib before callLib in the build order, as the
dependencies have been rearranged.

Remove special OpenSSL from code base.

Remove remnants of Openssl.
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-80

Clean problems related to isReadyToRead().
Remove call of isReadyToRead() from a debugging print, as that function blocks.
Report "residual" bytes after a SIP message as an error in UDP, but as debug
info in TCP and TLS.
Add some debugging prints.
Fix indenting.
http://paradise:8080/browse/ENG-198

Replace definition of "WD".

Put files that depend on the install directory into DISTCLEANFILES.

Use 'make' iterations to sequence through the components.

Add an orbits.xml file to the test configuration.

Fix typo.
