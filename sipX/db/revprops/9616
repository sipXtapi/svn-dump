Bugfix: Fix two bugs in NetInTask shutdown which may cause hang or crash.
1) NetInTask should be shutdown synchronously to avoid problems with access to spInstance from inside NetInTask::run().
2) requestShutdown() should called before sending message to control socket, or NetInTask will not process shutdown request, because it will blocked waiting for some data oncontrol socket.
