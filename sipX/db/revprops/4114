Bug fix for the media server cgi's:

1) The SIPXCHANGE_HOME environment variable should be retrieved from 
   the true environment (getenv) as opposed to the CgiValues wrapper.
2) The mediaserver cgi dumped core on execution because it was
   attempting to reference the CgiValue (gValues) before that
   data structure was initialized (while setting up log).  This was
   actually fixed by #1 above.
