Fix use of compareTo so non-default port designations are recognized as such.

Update DISTCLEANFILES.

Document invocation of autoreconf.

Add entries for sipXconference, but do not activate them.

Revamp handling of headers specified in URIs.

Statics are not your friend -- fix for SipMessage::SipMessageFieldProps.

Put parentheses around expression in #define.

Improve copyright notices.

Fix the sip*.sh.in scripts to check that the log files for their components
are either absent or writable, so the components can log any problems they
find.  Otherwise the components have no way of reporting problems.

Add sipXmediaAdapterLib as a component.

Link in a media subsystem.

Move mediaAdaptorLib before callLib in the build order, as the
dependencies have been rearranged.

Remove special OpenSSL from code base.

Remove call of isReadyToRead() from a debugging print, as that function blocks.

Report "residual" bytes after a SIP message as an error in UDP, but as debug
info in TCP and TLS.

Put files that depend on the install directory into DISTCLEANFILES.

Add an orbits.xml file to the test configuration.

Remove erroneous element in ProcessDefinitions.xml.

Fix typo in .spec file:  RPM is sipxcommserverlib-devel, not sipxcommserver-devel.

Add commentary based on an inquiry by Jerry Richards.

Add a file describing call flows for the call pick-up features.

Correct REPOSITORY for new repository structure.

Test fix for SipUserAgent/OsTimer/OsSysSoftTimer lockup:  Increase the message
queue sizes from 1,000 to 10,000.

Add more logging of transaction garbage collection.

Parse URIs correctly -- field parameters have their own unique quoting
system.

Add function SipMessage::isInSupportedField to allow easy testing for tokens
in the Supported header.

Add first cut of GRUU handling.

Enable siptest to send OKs in response to NOTIFYs.

Allow test configurations to use a realm that is different from the domain.

Add workaround for putative TinyXML parsing bug.

Add the code for the special Multi-Party Test redirector.
This can be used for multi-party loop/fork/spiral tests, and also as a
testbed for turning the redirectors into a proper set of hook
components.

Update the clean-check.sh script.

Add the dialog event testing tool.

Update svn:ignores properties.
