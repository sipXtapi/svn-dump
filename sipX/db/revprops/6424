XCF-937 - Add groups and settings to autoattendant, move sipxvxml velocity template to meaningful directory

autoattendant menu items, disconnect item had extraneous text from T4 migration

XCF-937 Add settings ui and default group to auto attendant management

XCF-937 Tailor special page for auto attendant defaults

AutoRefreshForm improvements: auto refresh checkbox and editing refresh interval implemented.
In order to use AutoRefreshForm on a page you need to set Border's property useDojo to true 

XCF-957 Generating orbits.xml file was failing when call parking description was empty ("null").
We are now skipping adding description component if it has not been set by the user.
