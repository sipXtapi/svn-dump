Fix a bug where "VACUUM ANALYZE", done as part of purging, collided with ActiveRecord transactions.  Set up careful transaction boundaries to avoid this problem.
Unsnarl the resolve method by moving all the daily run logic into a separate method.
When doing "VACUUM ANALYZE", only operate on SIPXCDR and don't touch SIPXCONFIG.
