[XPL-181] Fix connection peer caching
          (Initialize OsSSLConnectionSocket::mPeerIdentity in all
          constructors).  Thanks to Dale for finding this.

Improve top level make structure
  Ensure that projects are ordered based on dependencies
  Exit more quickly on failures
       (this latter is only a partial fix - the automake-generated
       recursion still goes on too long, but that's much harder to fix)
