Various 3.4 that should be in main.

mergefrom pingtel-main 6642,7174 

r6642:
(sipXportLib)
Handle unexpected errors from pthread_cond_wait() and pthread_cond_timedwait() by asserting.
Previous implementation might "spin" on unexpected errors.
Add more unit tests for mutexes and semaphores.

(sipXvxml)
Catch only the normal shutdown signals.
Let the others cause core dumps so
we can fix the problem.

r7174 contains these VoiceXML fixes made to 3.4 that should also be in main.

r6414:
(sipXvxml)
Change thread stack size from 1M to 128K.

r6612:
(sipXvxml)
Don't delete userAgent as the CallManger destructor does that.
If we delete it here, we get crashes when we CallManager tries to as well.
I don't agree that CallManager should delete userAgent, as userAgent
is passed in to CallManager, and thus should be deleted by whomever 
created it.  But this is the path of least resistance, as all other users
of CallManager seem to know not to delete the passed in object.
