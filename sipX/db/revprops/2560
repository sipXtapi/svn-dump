Changed all hardcoded default paths (many of which were relative) 
to be based on the compile time SIPX_HOME macro.  This is set
from the configure script to $prefix.

The real solution to this is issue XCS-5: creating a set of common 
code solutions to file locations, but this will address a number
of current issues for 2.5.2
