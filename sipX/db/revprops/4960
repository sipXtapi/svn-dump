XCF-561 New validator "validSipNameRequired" in tapestry.xml and a new parameter "nameValidator" that can be passed to ItemCommon component.
This allows us to control what kind of names we consider valid.
Internal dial plan name, Call Group name and Call Parking orbit name now has to follow the same rules as user part of SIP URL.
