Fixed the transaction timeout for non-INVITE 
SIP transactions.  The timer for non-INVITE
transactions was being set at the same timeout
as for INVITES (3+ minutes).  This caused some
noise in the logs which complained about a
transaction time out for a transaction that did
not exist.  The non-INVITE transactions were 
being garbage collected at the correct non-INVITE
transaction timeout.  Hense they were gone when
the longer timeout occured.
