Forked glib and slashed it down to 6 source files
and some stubs.  Currently memory
pooling is turned off (DISABLE_MEM_POOLS) to prevent
the need for the locking utilities in the g_threads
library.  Some of these stubs may no longer be needed
a second round of optimization (i.e. reducing) of these
stubs and the number of glib header files can probably
eliminate some more code.

The dsp files have been updated for Windows to eliminate
the dependency on glib.  The auto* tools config files
have not been updated yet to eliminate the glib dependency.

Still need to update the INSTALL file to update the
instructions for Windows.
