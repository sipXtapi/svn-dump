Update how NOTIFY bodies are constructed to allow customized content
to be generated for events that have no published content.
Change how memory is managed in the event publisher interface to make
life easier for callers.
Revise the users of the SUBSCRIBE server (including sipXtapi) to use
the changed interface.
Fix dialog event publisher to use the new default content constructor
and not null out content when the last call terminates.
Fix destructor for SipPublishContentMgr to delete sub-structures, to
reduce memory leaks.
Add debugging method to HttpBody.
Extend the number of places where eventType is used along side of
eventTypeKey, in order to support new default content constructors, as
well as to make the interfaces more regular.
Update unit tests.
Improve comments in sipXtackLib/src/test/Makefile.am.
