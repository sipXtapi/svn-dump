1) Added locking strategy for internal sipXtapi data structures.  2) Fixed
a bug where some operations failed on inbound calls.  3) Regenerated documentation.

I still need to take another pass on some of the internal documentation.
Also, the transfer unit tests now fail -- however, the test cases need
to be updated (as opposed to the code).
