Change DEFAULT_CODECS_PATH input to use unquoted string that then gets
stringified within the source via the C preprocessor.
This is to workaround a feature (bug) in the windows compiler whereby quoted
strings in preprocessor definitions are not allowed within project files.

Thus, to be consistent, the behavior was changed for all platforms.
See comments in MpMisc near the definition of CODEC_PLUGIN_PATH for more
information.
