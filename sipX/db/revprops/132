Fix XPL-33

This was actually a unit test bug.  The test assumed that it was
creating the OsNameDb and that therefor it would be initially empty.
Because OsNameDb is a singleton, it could have been created by any
earlier test and have contents left over from those tests (which
explains why the test passed when built in a test suite of its own but
failed when run after timer tests).

The test is modified now to remove that assumption.  It also does not
delete the OsNameDb at the end, since that's not something that
happens in the normal usage except at system shutdown.
