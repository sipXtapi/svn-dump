Support a plus sign in a voice mailbox name, and RFC-4240
(XPB-769)

If a user on the PBX is configured with a plus sign in the user name 
portion of the SIP URL (e.g. +13014170700@pbx...), the mailbox name will be
"+13014170700".

The major issue was the proxy not escaping the plus sign correctly when 
creating a URI to hand off to sipxVxml.  In HTTP escaping, a plus sign 
("+") is converted to a space.  As the "digits" portion of the URI was 
passed as an HTTP parameter embedded in a SIP URL parameter, an unescaped 
plus sign was being converted into a space by the http server serving 
the VoiceXML document, and so instead of seeing "mailbox=+13014170700", 
it would see "mailbox= 13014170700" and would fail looking up a mailbox 
that doesn't exist.

To support this, three new "magic" words were added to the mappingrules.xml
processing:
{user-escaped}
{digits-escaped}
{vdigits-escaped}

These three words are replaced with HTTP escaped versions of {user}, {digits}
and {vdigits}.

In addition, RFC-4240 defines the sip parameter "voicexml=" for the URL
of the voicexml document to execute, rather than the currently used "play=".
sipXvxml now supports either.

Documentation and defaults for voicexml= and {digits-escaped} changes.
Add config support for plus sign in voice mailbox name, and RFC-4240

Thanks for the code, Damian!
