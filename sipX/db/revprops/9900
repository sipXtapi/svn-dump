reimplementation of OsDateTime::getCurTime(OsTime&) under Microsoft Windows to use more accurate timeGetTime() as opposed to less accurate GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(FILETIME&).
This improves accuracy significantly.
Previous resolution was ~15ms, now, with timeGetTime, it is more like 2ms +/- 1ms (or perhaps slightly better).
