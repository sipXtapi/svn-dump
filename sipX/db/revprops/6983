A variety of modifications to improve the building process
Manage sipx version of w3c-libwww depending on distro
Use distro name RHE instead RHEL
Define platforms in order to set LIBWWW_RPM
We build and 'rpm -u sipx-w3c-libwww'
Initiate a LIBWWW_RPM setup process
Don't uninstall existing ruby RPMs since we don't build them for FC4/5

END
