    [XPB-281] Don't attempt to proxy messages to an unsupported domain
       The loop detection code didn't detect the case of the sender using
       a domain not configured for this server, but which resolved to the
       forking proxy and which the forking proxy sent to this server.
       We'll leave the proxying to the proxies, can just return a not
       found (with text to indicate that the domain is the problem).
