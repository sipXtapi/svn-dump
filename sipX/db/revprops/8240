Two fixes:

1) SipClients used to give up after 8 'bad packet' reads.  In
   testing, I found that sending a single INVITE (and then
   exiting the sending app / closing the socket) resulted in
   the SipClient closing w/ resends and attempting to cleanup
   the INVITE.  I increased this to 12.  In cases where the
   socket has gone bad, this will still exit fairly quickly.

2) Don't crash/double delete if the m= line includes multiple
   payloads (e.g. "0 8 97 97").
