Bridge mixer update:
1) testDisabled updated to current bridge behaviour - it does not produce buffers at all when disabled.
2) Simplify manual editing of mix matrix in testMixNormalWeights. Make it more fun with matrix, covering more mix cases.
3) Modify testMixNormalWeights so it correctly test case with fully muted output.
