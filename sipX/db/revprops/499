A few tweaks to the current stun implementation/integration:

1) STUN packets were mistakenly returned back to callers of the
   OsStunDatagramSocket.  It seems that all of existing the callers
   (Sip clients and RTP/RTCP clients) handle unexpected packet data
   fairly well. =)
2) Added more documentation to the OsStunDatagramSocket header file
3) Hardened the interface and implementation with asserts, check for
   memory allocation failures, etc.
