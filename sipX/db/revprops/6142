XCF-753 declare For loop in SettingsFieldset as volatile - it will prevent For component from trying to squezee the settings in the 
hidden field
it is quite safe not to do that since setting list does not depend on any of the form parameters, it only changes when someone changes the model and restarts sipXconfig
this fixes most of the settings based screens
