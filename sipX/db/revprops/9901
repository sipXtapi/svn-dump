Update most Microsoft windows Test project files to link to winmm.lib 
due to r9900 OsDateTime::getCurTime(OsTime&) change, 
as it now uses functions contained in the winmm.lib library.

Project files for the following compilers are updated:
Visual Studio 6 (MSVC6)
Visual Studio 2003
Visual Studio 2005 (including WinCE6 targets)

Microsoft eVC4 project files have *not* been updated yet, as they are
a pain to edit by hand it seems.  This will still need to be done for
that platform.

END
