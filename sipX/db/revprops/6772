Merge 6748,6759,6763 from sipfoundry 3.4:

Fix typo

Towards XPR-127 (logging impovements): include the log level with every log message so that messages can be filtered by log level, making it much easier to scan a log quickly for important messages.
Also clean up some remaining load path problems so that files get loaded only once.

For XPR-144 (CDR performance):
Create a call_id index and a call_id uniqueness constraint.  Create the index explicitly rather than relying on the implicit index generated by the uniqueness constraint.  That makes it possible to turn uniqueness and indexing on/off independently, which can be useful during bulk inserts.
