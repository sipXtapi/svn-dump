Copy the changes in Url and UrlTest (along with edits to integrate
with changes between the branches) from Pingel Main branch
dworley-URI-parsing so we can continue developing those changes based
on SIPfoundry Main.

svn merge -r 6958:6959 https://paradise.pingtel.com/rep/sipX/pingtel/branches/dworley-URI-parsing .

Rev 6959 was the only substantive change on that branch.  Its comment is:

    First checkpoint of revision to the URI parsing routines, and
    corresponding changes to the unit tests.

    Note that this code does not work -- Some of the tests are incorrect,
    and some fail.  The parsing routines are not fully corrected.

END
